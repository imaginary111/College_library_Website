Subsequently, high-temperature corrosion behavior of the bare and coated boiler steel was investigated at 700 Â°C for 50 cycles in Na 2SO 4- 82Fe 2(SO 4) 3 molten salt, as well as air environments. Weight-change measurements after each cycle were made to establish the kinetics of corrosion. X-ray diffraction, field emission-scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray mapping analyses were performed on the exposed samples to analyze the oxidation products. The bare 347H steel suffered accelerated oxidation during exposure at 700 Â°C in the air as well as the molten salt environment in comparison with its respective coated counterparts. The HVOF-spray Cr 3C 2-NiCr coating was found to be successful in maintaining its adherence in both the environments. The surface oxide scales were also found to be intact. The formation of chromium rich oxide scale might have contributed for the better hot corrosion/oxidation resistance in the coated steel.

The model simultaneously takes into account the fluid flow and heat transfer in the liquid droplet and the surrounding gas, and the heat transfer in the substrate. The liquid-gas interface was tracked using the volume of fluid method and the contact resistance between Al-33 wt.% Cu and the substrate was taken into account. The comprehensive model correctly predicted the total spread in the droplet. As per the predicted transient thermal field, the solidification front speed oscillated along the radius of the spread droplet. Based on the estimated front speeds at these locations and Jackson-Hunt plot for Al-33 wt.% Cu, the variation of interlamellar spacing along the radial direction was found. It matched well with the variation of the experimentally measured interlamellar spacing at different locations along the radius.

The wear behavior of the bare, Ni-20Cr and Ni 3Al-coated AISI 309 SS steel was investigated according to ASTM Standard G99-03 on a Pin-on-Disc Wear Test Rig. The wear tests were carried out at normal loads of 30 and 50 N with a sliding velocity of 1 m/s. Cumulative wear rate and coefficient of friction (Î¼) were calculated for all the cases. The worn-out surfaces were then examined by scanning electron microscopy analysis. Both the as-sprayed coatings exhibited typical splat morphology. The XRD analysis indicated the formation of Ni phase for the Ni-20Cr coating and Ni 3Al phase for the Ni 3Al coating. It has been concluded that the plasma-sprayed Ni-20Cr and Ni 3Al coatings can be useful to reduce the wear rate of AISI 309 SS steel. The coatings were found to be adherent to the substrate steel during the wear tests. The plasma-sprayed Ni 3Al coating has been recommended as a better choice to reduce the wear of AISI 309 SS steel, in comparison with the Ni-20Cr coating.

In the current investigation, Ni-20Cr alloy powder was deposited on SA 516 boiler steel (0.19C-1.07Mn-0.020S- 0.25P-0.010Si-balance Fe) by cold spray process. Oxidation kinetics was established for the uncoated and cold spray Ni-20Cr coated boiler steel in an aggressive environment of Na 2SO 4-60%V 2O 5 at 900 Â°C for 50 cycles by the weight change technique. X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM/EDAX, and x-ray mapping techniques were used to analyze the oxidation products.

Thermal management solutions for these severe operating conditions are subject to a number of constraints, including energy consumption, controllability, and the volume or size of the package. Calculations indicate that the only possible approach to meeting this heat flux condition, while maintaining the chip temperature below 65Â°C, is to utilize refrigeration. Here, we report an initial thermodynamic optimization of the refrigeration system design. In order to hold the outlet quality of the fluid leaving the evaporator to less than approximately 20%, in order to avoid reaching critical heat flux, the refrigeration system design is dramatically different from typical configurations for household applications. In short, a simple vapor-compression cycle will require excessive energy consumption, largely because of the additional heat required to return the refrigerant to its vapor state before the compressor inlet. A better design is determined to be a "two-loop" cycle, in which the vapor-compression loop is coupled thermally to a pumped loop that directly cools the high-heat-flux chip.

In the stable case of a dyed water sample having the same viscosity as that of displacing nondyed water, we analyze the transition between dispersive and advective transport of the passive scalar displaced linearly. At low displacement speed and after a certain time, the length of the sample increases as a square root of time allowing to compute the value of a dispersion coefficient. At larger injection speed, the displacement remains advective for the duration of the experiment, with a length of the sample increasing linearly in time. A parametric study allows to gain insight into the switch from one regime to another as a function of the gap width of the cell. In the unstable case of viscous glycerol samples displaced by dyed water, the rear interface of the sample where less viscous water pushes more viscous glycerol is unstable with regard to viscous fingering. The interface deforms into fingers, the number and size of which depend on the viscosity ratio between the two solutions and on the displacement speed.

Most of the research conducted till date has not reported any effort to excavate the effect of cryogenic treatment on the performance of coated tungsten carbide inserts in terms of adhesion strength of coatings deposited on tungsten carbide substrate. In order to understand the effect of cryogenic treatment on the adhesion strength of coatings, a comparative investigation of the wear behaviour and machining performance of cryogenically treated coated tungsten carbide inserts in orthogonal turning has been carried out in this study. The commercially available TiAlN coated square shaped tungsten carbide inserts (P25) were procured and subjected to cryogenic treatment at two levels -110 Â°C (shallow treatment) and -196 Â°C (deep treatment) of temperature independently. The criterion selected for determining the turning performance was based on the maximum flank wear (0.6 mm) as recommended in ISO 3685-1993. The results showed that shallow cryogenically treated coated tungsten carbide inserts performed significantly better as compared with deep cryogenically treated and untreated inserts. Major outcome of the present study includes a substantial decrease in tool life of deep cryogenically treated inserts as compared to untreated inserts indicating the destructive effect of deep cryogenic temperature (-196 Â°C) on TiAlN coated inserts which is further supported by VDI-3198 indentation test.

On the contrary, the Ni - 20Cr coated steel followed a parabolic rate law and showed reduced rates of corrosion in comparison with its uncoated counterpart. The loss of material owing to high temperature corrosion of the steel was reduced appreciably after the application of the coating.

Metallurgists comprehend how tool steels respond to cryogenic treatment, but they also understand that for many years, the cryogenic treatment of tool steels had the reputation of being a quick fix for poor heat treatment practice. During the cryogenic treatment of tool steels, the process modifies the carbon present in the tool steels. However, cryogenic treatment has not been widely adopted by the cutting tools industry due to lack of understanding of the fundamental metallurgical mechanisms and due to the wide variation in reported research findings. In the present paper, an attempt has been made to review the literature on metallurgical changes that occurred during the cryogenic treatment of tool steels to benefit the cutting tools industry. The prominent reasons found to be responsible for improving the mechanical properties of tool steels are transformation of retained austenite to martensite and precipitation of fine carbides.

Materials were characterized by a complementary combination of X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, and transmission electron microscopy. Metal oxides synthesized using this route have remarkably high surface area when compared with the commercial samples. The surface area of metal oxides decreased upon calcination at higher temperatures. However, the surface area was still much higher when compared with the commercial samples. TEM investigation reveals that upon calcination at higher temperature, the size of the crystal increased but the short range order was merely disturbed. The analyses show that the present method is suitable as a direct route to synthesize crystalline nanoporous metal oxides. Hydrogen bonding plays a key role in the preferential arrangement of porous metal-carbon structure in the domain of tri-block copolymer.

The specimens with and without coating were exposed to the super heater zone of a thermal power plant boiler at a temperature of 973 K (700 Â°C) under cyclic conditions to ascertain their erosion-corrosion (E-C) behavior. High-temperature oxidation behavior of the specimens was also evaluated under cyclic thermal loading conditions at an elevated temperature of 1173 K (900 Â°C). Mass change data and thickness loss were measured to formulate the kinetics of E-C/oxidation for the specimens. The exposed specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission-scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS). The uncoated steel suffered higher E-C in comparison with its coated counterpart in terms of mass loss as well as thickness loss. It was observed that overall mass loss was reduced by 31 pct and thickness loss by 44 pct after the application of the coating. The possible formation of Cr2O3 phase in the coated substrate may be suggested to contribute to better E-C behavior. During air oxidation exposures, the coating was found to be intact with only marginal spallation of its oxide scales, which is an indicator of good adhesion between the coating and substrate steel. The air oxidation mass change data indicated that the coating enhanced the oxidation resistance of the steel by 85 pct.

The expressions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, stream function, frictional force and mechanical efficiency are obtained under the small Reynolds number and the large wavelength approximations. Effects of different physical parameters reflecting permeability parameter, couple-stress parameter, Hartmann number as well as amplitude ratio on pumping characteristics, frictional force, mechanical efficiency and trapping of peristaltic flow pattern are studied.

Specimens were also exposed to the superheater zone of a thermal power plant boiler at an average temperature of 700 Â°C under cyclic conditions to ascertain their erosion-corrosion (E-C) behavior. Mass-change measurements were taken to approximate the kinetics of corrosion and erosion-corrosion. In the case of E-C, the thickness lost data were also taken at the end of the exposure. The exposed specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS).

It was also reported that Cu 47.5Zr 47.5Al 5 BMG composite shows a very high strength together with an extensive work hardening-like behavior of large ductility around 18%. In this study, the influence of superheat on microstructure and the resulting mechanical properties in Cu 47.5Zr 47.5Al 5 bulk metallic glass-matrix composite alloy has been studied. The Cu 47.5Zr 47.5Al 5 melt solidifies into a composite microstructure consisting of crystalline precipitates embedded in an amorphous matrix. The crystalline phase consists of B2 CuZr (cubic primitive with CsCl structure) with a small amount of monoclinic CuZr martensitic structure embedded in an amorphous matrix. The volume fraction of crystalline phases varies with melting current as well as position along the length of the as-cast rod, depending on the local cooling condition. The volume fraction and the distribution of the crystalline precipitates are heterogeneous in the amorphous matrix. Room temperature uniaxial compression tests revealed high yield strength ranging from 796 to 1900 MPa depending upon the volume fraction of the crystalline phases present. The presence of the dendritic B2 CuZr significantly improved the ductility. The BMG composites show a pronounced plastic strain up to 14% for the higher volume fraction of crystalline phase.

Intentionally inducing vibration to make machining system sustainable started from the work of Kumabe. Based on the direction of modulation with respect to workpiece motion three distinct effective conditions develop, Vibration Assisted Machining (VAM) by inducing low amplitude and high frequency vibration in cutting velocity direction, Modulation Assisted Machining (MAM) by inducing high amplitude and low frequency vibration in tool feed direction and Elliptical Vibration Assisted Machining (EVAM) by inducing low amplitude and high frequency vibration both in tool feed and cutting velocity direction. For superimposing vibration to tool motion in VAM, EVAM and MAM systems, the piezoelectric transducer device based tool holder attachments have been used. Imposing of oscillation by piezoelectric actuators in machining reduces the machining forces and burr suppression, which decreases energy consumption and hence makes system energy efficient. MAM can produce chips of required shape and size distribution which can be used by another production system without any pre-processing. Vibration in machining also helps to increase the tool life and reduce overall cost of production; it also helps in improving tool chip contact conditions so as to improve surface finish. This paper presents a review of these technologies with the help of a survey of the studies conducted in this direction.

This article demonstrates the successful formulation of Ni-20Cr and Ni-50Cr coatings on two boiler steels, namely, SAE 213-T22 and SA 516 steel by cold-spray process. The microstructure, coating thickness, phase formation, and microhardness properties of the coatings were evaluated. The coatings were subjected to cyclic heating and cooling cycles at an elevated temperature of 1173.15 K (900 Â°C) to ascertain their high-temperature oxidation behavior. Moreover, these cyclic exposures can give useful information regarding the adhesion of the coatings with the substrate steels. Of all the coatings, the Ni-50Cr coating on SA 516 steel had a maximum average hardness value of 469 Hv. As observed from the surface field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis, the coatings were found to have nearly dense microstructure with the sprayed particles in interlocked positions. It was concluded that the cold-spray process is suitable for spraying the preceding powders onto the given boiler steels to produce nearly dense and low oxide coatings. The coatings, in general, were found to follow the parabolic rate of oxidation and were successful in maintaining their surface contact with their respective substrate steels.

In order to understand the mechanism accountable for enhanced tool life of tungsten carbide inserts, a comparative investigation of the wear behavior and machining performance of cryogenically treated tungsten carbide inserts in orthogonal turning has been carried out in this study. The commercially available uncoated square shaped tungsten carbide inserts (P25) were procured and subjected to cryogenic treatment at two levels -110C (shallow treatment) and -196C (deep treatment) of temperature independently. The criterion selected for determining the turning performance was based on the maximum flank wear (0.6mm) as recommended in ISO 3685-1993and surface roughness (Ra) of the workpiece. The results showed that cryogenically treated tungsten carbide inserts performed significantly better as compared with untreated ones.

We then discuss some of the challenges encountered when analyzing these standards. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential for an expanded approach that could assist in the development of domain models and ultimately help identify necessary actions in business processes that will lead to additional standard compliance.

High temperature corrosion behaviour was investigated for the uncoated and HVOF sprayed Ni-20Cr coated boiler steel in a simulated boiler environment (Na 2SO 4-60%V 2O 5) at 900Â°C for 50 cycles. The information regarding this system of coating-substrate steel-coating process with regard to its high temperature corrosion is not available in the open literature. Each cycle consisted of one hour heating in the silicon carbide tube furnace followed by 20 min. cooling in air. Mass change technique was used to approximate the kinetics of corrosion. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive (SEM/EDS) were used to characterise the corrosion products. It was observed that the uncoated steel suffered corrosion in the form of spalled powder and peeling up of its oxide scale. On the contrary, the Ni-20Cr coating provided considerable resistance to the corrosion. The Ni-20Cr coating was successful in reducing the mass gain of the steel by 77% which may be due to the formation of oxides of nickel and chromium in its oxide scale.

In the present work an analysis methodology, based on a combination of upper bound and energy approaches, is proposed for the prediction of number of wrinkles and minimum blankholding pressure necessary to avoid wrinkling in redrawing operation. Thickness variation predicted by the upper bound formulation is used as input for the wrinkling analysis by assuming a suitable waveform based on geometrical and process conditions. The flange is constrained at both ends, i.e., by the blank holder profile radius and at the die entry point (where the sheet enters into the die cavity). The waveform for present analysis is assumed such that it has zero displacement at both ends (since it is constrained) and the maximum amplitude of the wave at some point in between those ends. The wrinkling predicted by the present methodology seems to be reasonably accurate considering the geometrical and process constraints of the redraw.

The receptors act as selective colorimetric, naked eye sensors for small and spherical F - ion with some interference from tetrahedral H 2PO 4 - ions. Thiourea derivatives form stable 1:1 H-bonded complexes with F - anion and to some extent with H 2PO 4 - anions, whereas for urea derivatives, the recognition is simply based on acid-base reaction between ureidic protons and basic F - ions and is a completely reversible phenomenon. The pre-organisation of thiourea derivatives coupled with their high-intrinsic acidity is supposed to help them in the formation of strong H-bonded complexes with F - anion. The urea-based receptors do not respond at lower concentrations of the anion, but at higher concentrations, they undergo completely reversible deprotonation concomitant with a colorimetric change, with the production of stable [HF 2] - anion.

Homotopy analysis method is used to solve the problem and obtain the approximate analytical solution in terms of axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, stream function and mechanical efficiency under the long wavelength approximation. It is assumed that the cross-section of the tube varies sinusoidally along the length of tube. The impacts of fractional parameters, material constants, time and amplitude on the pressure difference, frictional force across one wavelength and trapping, are depicted numerically. It is found that the second material constant helps the flow pattern, whereas the other three material constants resist it through the peristaltic tube.

The motion of the wall is governed by the sinusoidal wave equation. The analytical and numerical solutions for the axial velocity, the micro-polar vector, the stream function, the pressure gradient, the friction force, and the mechanical efficiency are obtained by using the lubrication theory under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations. The impacts of the emerging parameters, such as the coupling number, the micro-polar parameter, the slip parameter on pumping characteristics, the friction force, the velocity profile, the mechanical efficiency, and the trapping phenomenon are depicted graphically. The numerical results infer that large pressure is required for peristaltic pumping when the coupling number is large, while opposite behaviors are found for the micro-polar parameter and the slip parameter. The size of the trapped bolus reduces with the increase in the coupling number and the micro-polar parameter, whereas it blows up with the increase in the slip parameter.

XRD and FT-IR confirm the formation of a mixture of Cu(OH) 2 and CuO after 0.5h of hydrothermal treatment and pure CuO after 2h of hydrothermal treatment. The formation mechanisms were proposed based on the SEM and TEM analysis, which show that both, alcohol/polymeric surfactant and hydrothermal time play an important role in tuning the morphology and structure of CuO. Surface area of metal oxides depends on the alcohols and the nonionic polymeric surfactants used in the synthesis. Surface area of CuO synthesized using methanol was found to be the highest. The catalytic activity of as-synthesized CuO was demonstrated by using three-component coupling reaction in the synthesis of propargylamine and catalytic oxidation of methylene blue in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Among the CuO prepared in this study, the CuO synthesized using methanol exhibited better catalytic activity (propargylamine yield (64.5%)) and the highest rate of methylene blue degradation (13Ã—10 -3min -1).

The shock and the rarefaction waves, the local cluster effect and the phase transition are investigated through simulation experiments with the new model and are found to be consistent with the diverse nonlinear dynamical phenomena observed in a real traffic flow. The analysis also focuses on empirically observed two-lane phenomena, such as lane usage inversion and the density dependence of the number of lane changes. It is shown that single-lane dynamics can be extended to multilane cases without changing the basic properties of the single-lane model.

The food bolus is supposed to be viscous fluid and the geometry of wall surface of oesophagus is considered as peristaltic wave. The expressions for temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity, volume flow rate, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress, mechanical efficiency, stream function and reflux limit are obtained under the assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The effect of heat transfer on two inherent phenomena (reflux and trapping) of peristaltic flow is discussed numerically. The comparative study of integral and non-integral number of wave propagating along the channel is discussed under influence of emerging physical parameters. Revelation is that when the magnitude of Grashof number and thermal conductivity increase the pressure along the entire length of the channel reduces whereas the efficiency of pumping increases. Reflux region is found to be increasing function of the both parameters. It is found that the size of upper trapped bolus contracts while size of lower trapped bolus expands with increasing the effect of heat transfer. Â© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The walls of the tube are subjected to the contraction waves that do not cross the stationary boundaries. The analysis is carried out by a long wavelength approximation in the non-dimensional form. The expressions for the axial and radial velocities are derived. The pressures across the wavelength and the tubelength are also estimated. The reflux phenomenon is discussed, which culminates into the determination of the reflux limit. Mathematical formulations are physically interpreted for the flow of masticated food materials such as bread and white eggs in the oesophagus. It is revealed that the Maxwell fluids are favorable to flow in the oesophagus as compared with the Newtonian fluids. This endorses the experimental finding of Takahashi et al.

The study reports microstructural changes taking place in a Mg-based alloy (AE42) subjected to FSP under different cooling conditions. The FSP process was carried out with single as well as multipass options. The friction stir processed samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), focused ion beam (FIB)-scanning ion microscopy (SIM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was observed that FSP tends to fragment the elongated precipitates and produces near homogeneous distribution of fine particles. The smallest particle size was observed to be produced by double-pass FSP supplemented by rapid cooling, thereby generating in situ nanocomposites. Vickers micro-hardness testing was done along the thickness (transverse direction) of the specimen to study and understand the variation of hardness with thickness. Nearly a two-times increase in the microhardness of AE42 was observed in the case of double-pass, FSP AE42 with cooling at temperature of approximately 253 K (-20 Â°C). To confirm these observations, another magnesium alloy AM50 was also friction stir processed under similar conditions. The fine submicron grain structure produced in AE42 alloy contributed immensely toward grain boundary strengthening and Orowan strengthening had only marginal influence. Subgrain boundary pinning by in situ nanoparticles contributed significantly in the strengthening process.

The spatially averaged but temporally fluctuating behaviour of the hydrostatic component of the virial stress is observed in both time and frequency domains at a mean stress-free state for a nanostructure at a target temperature. An atomistic-scale model with one finite dimension and two infinite dimensions was utilized to represent a thin single crystal film. Numerical simulations were performed with force fields and lattice parameters corresponding to gold. The initial temperature, pressure, and volume states for the material were determined using two equilibrium procedures that produced convergent energy and stress states. The dynamics of the virial stresses in atomistic ensembles show several dynamic and local characteristics of the continuum stresses.

The analysis was restricted to propagation of small-amplitude harmonic waves, generated due to blood flow whose wave length is larger compared to the radius of the arterial segment. The impacts of viscosity of fluid in peripheral layer and intermediate layer on the interfaces, average flow rate, mechanical efficiency, trapping and reflux are discussed with the help of numerical and computational results. This model is the generalized form of the preceding models. On the basis of present discussion, it is found that the size of intermediate and peripheral layers reduces in expanded region and enhances in contracted region with the increasing viscosity of fluid in peripheral layer, whereas, opposite effect is observed for viscosity of fluid in intermediate layer. Final conclusion is that the average flow rate and mechanical efficiency increase with the increasing viscosity of fluid in both layers, however, the effects of the viscosity of fluid in both layers on trapping and reflux are opposite to each other.

Analysis is carried out for four different kinds of partial edge compression and it is extended to study the effect of aspect ratio of plate on buckling load. Design/methodology/approach: A finite element method technique is used in the current work to solve the buckling problem of plate using eight node quadrilateral element and plate kinematics based on first order shear deformation theory. Results obtained from finite element analysis are first validated for isotropic square plates, without cutouts, subjected to uniaxial partial edge compression with some earlier published literature. Findings: From the current work it is concluded that the buckling strength of square plates is highly influenced by partial edge compression, as compared to plate subjected to uniform edge compression; but with increase in aspect ratio, influence of partial edge compression on plate buckling load decreases. Originality/value: This paper usefully shows how partial edge compression of plates affects the buckling strength of plate having circular cutouts. Generally, simply supported plates subjected uniaxial partial edge compression of Type I and Type III are found to be stronger than plates subjected to partial edge compression Type II and Type IV, respectively.

The model combined modeling function of fuzzy inference with the learning ability of artificial neural network; and a set of rules has been generated directly from experimental data. It was determined that the predictions usually agreed well with the experimental data with correlation coefficients of 0.994 and mean errors of 2.47%. The proposed model can also be used for estimating tool flank wear on-line but the accuracy of the model depends upon the proper training and selection of data points. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study reveals that introduction of SEZs in place of its predecessor, the Export Processing Zone, is having a significant and positive impact on its trade performance at the aggregate level. However, in terms of contribution to national trade, the Indian SEZs are lagging way behind the expectations of policymakers. Furthermore, the SEZ policy does not seem to be successful in diversifying the exports basket, which in turn has affected the direction of exports by the SEZs. Moreover, these zones were found to be highly susceptible to external shocks. Thus, we strongly argue in favour of a care in deciding the sectoral choice of SEZs and careful scrutiny of its approval across major Indian states.

These oxides were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The surface area of metal oxides depends on the amino acid used in the synthesis. The formation mechanisms were proposed based on the experimental results, which show that amino acid/citric acid/tartaric acid and hydrothermal time play an important role in tuning the morphology and structure of CuO. The catalytic activity of as-synthesized CuO was demonstrated by catalytic oxidation of methylene blue in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2). CuO synthesized using tyrosine was found to be the best catalyst compared to a variety of CuO synthesized in this study. CuO (synthesized in this study)-modified electrodes were used for the construction of non-enzymatic sensors, which displayed excellent electrocatalytic response for the detection of H 2O 2 and glucose compared to conventional CuO. The high electrocatalytic response observed for the CuO synthesized using tyrosine can be correlated with the large surface area, which enhances the accessibility of H 2O 2/glucose molecule to the active site that results in high observed current. The methodology adopted in the present study provides a new platform for the fabrication of CuO-based high-performance glucose and other biosensors.

Reynolds number is small enough and the wavelength to diameter ratio is large enough to negate inertial effects. Analytical solutions for axial velocity, pressure gradient, frictional force, stream function and mechanical efficiency are obtained. Effects of different physical parameters reflecting couple-stress parameter, permeability parameter, slip parameter, as well as amplitude ratio on pumping characteristics and frictional force, streamlines pattern and trapping of peristaltic flow pattern are studied with particular emphasis. The computational results are presented in graphical form. This study puts forward an important observation that pressure reduces by increasing the magnitude of couple-stress parameter, permeability parameter, slip parameter, whereas it enhances by increasing the amplitude ratio.

However, the mechanistic heterogeneity that potentially underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery of etiology for most developmental psychiatric disorders. Another, perhaps less palpable, reality may also be interfering with progress - heterogeneity in typically developing populations. In this report we attempt to clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using graph theory and community detection.Wesought to determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be discerned in children with and without the disorder. Because individual classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation, we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify how well ADHD status in individual children can be identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes. The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing children with ADHD children within each of these distinct subgroups increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests that typically developing children can be classified into distinct neuropsychological subgroups with high precision.

A magnesium based alloy AE42 was friction stir processed (FSPed) at different FSP parameters and cooling conditions. Temperature history was continuously recorded in the nugget zone during FSP using data acquisition system and k type thermocouples. The developed code was validated at different FSP parameters and cooling conditions during FSP experimentation. The temperature history at different locations in the nugget zone at different instants of time was further utilized for the estimation of grain growth rate and final average grain size of the FSPed specimen. A regression equation relating the final grain size, maximum temperature during FSP and the cooling rate was developed. The metallurgical characterization was done using optical microscopy, SEM, and FIB-SIM analysis. The simulated temperature profiles and final average grain size were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.

The estimation of these rates requires the knowledge of Gamow-Teller strength distributions in the Î² + direction. Astrophysical models rely on electron-capture rate tables largely based on theoretical models, which must be validated and tested against experimental results. Purpose: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the ability of theoretical models to reproduce experimental Gamow-Teller transition strength distributions measured via (n,p)-type charge-exchange reactions at intermediate beam energies. The focus is on transitions from stable nuclei in the pf shell (45â‰¤Aâ‰¤64). In addition, the impact of deviations between experimental and theoretical Gamow-Teller strength distributions on derived stellar electron-capture rates is investigated. Method: Data on Gamow-Teller transitions from 13 nuclei in the pf shell measured via charge-exchange reactions and supplemented with results from Î²-decay experiments where available, were compiled and compared with strength distributions calculated in shell models (using the GXPF1a and KB3G effective interactions) and quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) using ground-state deformation parameters and masses from the finite-range droplet model. Electron-capture rates at relevant stellar temperatures and densities were derived for all distributions and compared. Results: With few exceptions, shell-model calculations in the pf model space with the KB3G and GXPF1a interactions qualitatively reproduce experimental Gamow-Teller strength distributions of 13 stable isotopes with 45â‰¤Aâ‰¤64. Results from QRPA calculations exhibit much larger deviations from the data and overestimate the total experimental Gamow-Teller strengths. For stellar densities in excess of 107 g/cm3, ground-state electron-capture rates derived from the shell-model calculations using the KB3G (GXPF1a) interaction deviate on average less than 47% (31%) from those derived from experimental data for which the location of daughter states at low excitation energies are well established. For electron-capture rates derived from Gamow-Teller strengths calculated in QRPA, the deviations are much larger, especially at low stellar densities. Conclusions: Based on the limited set of test cases available for nuclei in the pf shell, shell-models using the GXPF1a and KB3G interactions can be used to estimate electron-capture rates for astrophysical purposes with relatively good accuracy. Measures of the uncertainties in these rates can serve as input for sensitivity studies in stellar evolution models. Ground-state electron-capture rates based on the QRPA formalism discussed in the paper exhibit much larger deviations than those based on the shell-model calculations and should be used with caution, especially at low stellar densities.

Motivated by the objective of improving an understanding of the complex fluid dynamics in such flows, we consider in the present article the transient magneto-fluid flow and heat transfer through a finite length channel by peristaltic pumping. Reynolds number is small enough and the wavelength to diameter ratio is large enough to negate inertial effects. Analytical solutions for temperature field, axial velocity, transverse velocity, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress, volume flowrate and averaged volume flowrate are obtained. The effects of the transverse magnetic field, Grashof number and thermal conductivity on the flow patterns induced by peristaltic waves (sinusoidal propagation along the length of channel) are studied using graphical plots. The present study identifies that greater pressure is required to propel the magneto-fluid by peristaltic pumping in comparison to a non-conducting Newtonian fluid, whereas, a lower pressure is required if heat transfer is effective. The analytical solutions further provide an important benchmark for future numerical simulations.

This characteristic can be utilized to effectively capture and transport solar radiation. Enhancement of the solar irradiance absorption capacity leads to a higher heat transfer rate resulting in more efficient heat transfer. This paper attempts to introduce the idea of harvesting solar radiant energy through usage of nanofluid-based concentrating parabolic solar collectors (NCPSC). In order to theoretically analyze the NCPSC, it has been mathematically modeled, and the governing equations have been numerically solved using finite difference technique. The results of the model were compared with the experimental results of conventional concentrating parabolic solar collectors under similar conditions. It was observed that while maintaining the same external conditions (such as ambient/inlet temperatures, wind speed, solar insolation, flow rate, concentration ratio, etc.) the NCPSC has about 5-10% higher efficiency as compared to the conventional parabolic solar collector. Furthermore, parametric studies were carried out to discover the influence of various parameters on performance and efficiency. The following parameters were studied in the present study: solar insolation, incident angle, and the convective heat transfer coefficient. The theoretical results clearly indicate that the NCPSC has the potential to harness solar radiant energy more efficiently than a conventional parabolic trough.

Wood is one of the most commonly used house hold building material it has both structural and decorative applications. It is used both in natural and processed form like ply wood, veneer, ply-board etc. Defects like knots, worm track, delaminations, glue smear etc. influences its in-service capabilities. Even though various non-destructive methods such as optical, ultrasonic and radiography are commonly used to inspect wooden materials, infrared imaging has its own advantage due to its safe, whole field inspection capabilities. This paper describes the applicability of the transient thermal wave imaging (TWI) method for inspection of ply wood.

The XRD results showed the presence of WC as the primary phase along with W2C and Co6W6C as secondary phases. Furthermore, the slurry erosion behavior of the coatings was investigated to ascertain the usefulness of the coatings to reduce the slurry erosion of the steels. The effect of four operating factors viz. the velocity, impact angle, concentration, and particle size on the slurry erosion of coated and bare steels has been studied using a high-speed jet-type test rig. The sand used as an erodent was collected from a power plant to replicate the actual turbine conditions. It has been observed that the given cermet coating can enhance the erosion resistance of the steel. Velocity was found to be the most significant factor affecting the erosion behavior of the coating, whereas it was the erodent particle size in the case of uncoated steel. As evidenced from the SEM images, the platelet mechanism of erosion seemed to be the prominent one, causing the removal of material from the surface of the steel, whereas for the coating, the formation and interlinking of cracks resulted in the removal of material.

An extensively-validated biofluid dynamics variational finite element code, BIOFLOW, is employed to obtain comprehensive computational solutions for the flow regime which is described using a spatially two-dimensional momentum equation and a spatially one-dimensional mass transport equation, under appropriate boundary conditions. The Nakamura-Sawada rheological model is employed which provides a higher yield stress than the Casson model. A non-Newtonian model is justified on the basis that blood exhibits deviation from Newtonian behavior at low shear rates. The conduit considered is rigid with a pulsatile pressure applied via an appropriate pressure gradient term. One hundred two-noded line elements have been employed in the computations. The influence of magnetic field on the flow is studied via the magnetohydrodynamic body force parameter (Nm), which defines the ratio of magnetic (Lorentz) retarding force to the viscous hydrodynamic force. Blood vessel blockage effects are simulated with a Darcy-Forchheimer nonlinear drag force model incorporating a Darcian linear impedance for low Reynolds numbers and a Forchheimer quadratic drag for higher Reynolds numbers. Transformed velocity and concentration profiles are plotted for the influence of Reynolds number (Re), Darcy parameter (Î»), Forchheimer inertial drag parameter (NF), non-Newtonian parameter (Î²), and Schmidt number (Sc) and at various times (T).

Materials were characterized by a complementary combination of X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Experimental evidences show that metal oxides are incorporated in the pore wall of SBA-15 matrices. A non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor device was fabricated for glucose detection based on M-SBA-15 materials. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the M-SBA-15 modified electrode toward glucose. It was found that the Cu-SBA-15 (Si/Cu. =. 20) modified electrode showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose in alkaline solution compared to that of the conventional CuO and other M-SBA-15 materials investigated in this study.

A sinusoidal model is employed for the oscillating flow regime. A modified Darcy-Brinkman model is utilized to simulate the flow of a generalized Maxwell fluid in a homogenous, isotropic porous medium. The governing equations are simplified by assuming long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations. The numerical and approximate analytical solutions of the problem are obtained by a semi-numerical technique, namely the homotopy perturbation method. The influence of the dominating physical parameters such as fractional Maxwell parameter, relaxation time, amplitude ratio, and permeability parameter on the flow characteristics are depicted graphically. The size of the trapped bolus is slightly enhanced by increasing the magnitude of permeability parameter whereas it is decreased with increasing amplitude ratio. Furthermore, it is shown that in the entire pumping region and the free pumping region, both volumetric flow rate and pressure decrease with increasing relaxation time, whereas in the co-pumping region, the volumetric flow rate is elevated with rising magnitude of relaxation time.

It begins with a consideration of the biological explanations of binding, viz., conjunctive coding, synchrony, and reentrant mechanisms. Thereafter binding is reviewed as a psychological process guided by top-down signals. The stages and types of binding proposed by various researchers are discussed in this section. The next section introducesWorking Memory (WM) as the executive directing the top-down signals. After that it is described how WM works by selecting relevant sensory input, followed by a detailed consideration of the debate regarding objects vs. features with the conclusion that relevance is the key factor determining what is processed.The next section considers other factors affecting the selection of relevant input.Then, we shift focus to describe what happens to irrelevant input - whether it is discarded at the outset or is gradually inhibited, and whether inhibition is a perceptual or post-perceptual process. The concluding section describes the process of binding as currently understood on the basis of the literature included in the review.To summarize, it appears that initially the "object" is conceptualized as an instantaneous bundle of all features. However, only relevant features of stimuli are gradually integrated to form a stable representation of the object. Concomitantly, irrelevant features are removed from the object representations. Empirical evidence suggests that the inhibition of irrelevant features occurs over time and is presumably a process within WM.

Previous resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) studies have sough to understand the neural correlates of ADHD by comparing connectivity measurement between those with and without the disorder, focusing primarily on cortical-striatal circuits mediated by the thalamus. To integrate the multiple phenotypic features associated with ADHD and help resolve its heterogeneity, it is helpful to determine how specific circuits relate to unique cognitive domains of the ADHD syndrome. Spatial working memory has been proposed as a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Methods: We cor-related the rs-fcMRI of five thalamic regions of interest (ROIs) with spatial span working memory scores in a sample of 67 children aged 7-11 years [ADHD and typically develop ing children (TDC)]. In an independent dataset, we then examined group differences in thalamo-striatal functional connectivity between 70 ADHD and 89 TDC (7-11 years) from the ADHD-200 dataset. Thalamic ROIs were created based on previous methods that uti lize known thalamo-cortical loops and rs-fcMRI to identify functional boundaries in the thalamus. Results/Conclusion: Using these thalamic regions, we found atypical rs-fcMR between specific thalamic groupings with the basal ganglia. To identify the thalamic con nections that relate to spatial working memory in ADHD, only connections identified in both the correlational and comparative analyses were considered. Multiple connections between the thalamus and basal ganglia, particularly between medial and anterior dor-sal thalamus and the putamen, were related to spatial working memory and also altered in ADHD. These thalamo-striatal disruptions may be one of multiple atypical neural and cognitive mechanisms that relate to the ADHD clinical phenotype.

Hardness of the FSPed specimens was considered as the output response of the experimental design. Cooling temperature during FSP, FSP tool rotational speed, and number of FSP passes were found to be the most influential FSP parameters in the current investigation.

Bulk HA coating was amorphous; however, the addition of TiO2 effectively improved the crystallinity of HA in HA-TiO2 coating. The SEM analysis confirmed the formation of a wellformed HA-TiO2 composite coating. HA coating exhibited higher bond strength (67.8 MPa) compared with HA-TiO2 composite coating (37.6 MPa).

Interestingly, most of the experimental studies have been done on elemental samples. There exist a few studies on compound materials, but among them studies on compound semiconductors are extremely rare. It is to be borne in mind that sputtering in case of compound targets is pretty much different from their elemental counterparts since preferential sputtering plays a major role in such situations. The present article is an attempt to review nanopatterning studies on SiGe surfaces using low-energy ion beams. It is found that pattern formation on such surfaces is greatly influenced by a number of factors like sputter yield effects, initial surface morphologies, constitution of the ion beam, and other effects. Discussion of such effects provides a thorough insight into the sputter patterning phenomenon of such compound semiconductors.

Electrocatalytic activity of conventional ZSM-5-modified electrodes was significantly low compared to nanocrystalline ZSM-5-modified electrodes. Enhancement in the electrocatalytic activities of nanocrystalline ZSM-5-modified electrodes can be correlated with the enhanced accessibility of glucose/methanol to M2+ active centers in the nanocrystalline ZSM-5 owing to its large specific surface area and intercrystalline mesopores.

Much of the first decade of nanofluid research was focused on measuring and modeling fundamental thermophysical properties of nanofluids (thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, convection coefficients). Recent research, however, has started to highlight how nanofluids might perform in a wide variety of other applications. These applications range from their use in nanomedicine [2] to their use as solar energy harvesting media [3]. By analyzing the available body of research to date, this article presents trends of where nanofluid research is headed and suggests which applications may benefit the most from employing nanofluids. Overall, this review summarizes the novel applications and uses of nanofluids while setting the stage for future nanofluid use in industry.

Structure analysis, by Rietveld refinements of X-ray diffraction patterns, reveals that the substitution is preferred at octahedral 4f2 site up to x = 0.4 dopant concentration whereas, at higher concentration (x âˆ¼ 1.0), Co 2+ ions enter into 4f2 while Zr4+ ions occupy both 4f2 and trigonal bipyramidal 2b (pseudotetrahedral) sites. The maximum substitution was attained at x = 1.0. This study reveals that site preferences depend upon both the nature of dopants and their concentration. The substitution causes a decrease in hyperfine field for all five crystallographic sites.

However, there are several research challenges to ensure sufficient efficiency and reliability for ensuring widespread implementation. Integration of a parabolic trough solar collector utilizing a mixture of nanoparticles and water with a vapor absorption system has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of the system. Such a system makes use of the superior thermo-physical properties of the nanofluid compared to the base fluid. Moreover, the direct absorption phenomenon of solar radiation through interaction with the participating medium (nanofluid) results in a higher temperature rise of the medium in conjunction with higher operating efficiencies as well. At the same time there are certain challenges that need to be identified and addressed in the implementation of this novel concept. For instance, to make it reliable, the system further needs to be integrated with a thermal storage system which facilitates air-conditioning even during non-sunshine hours. Integration of vapor absorption refrigeration technology, parabolic trough with water-nanoparticles mixture as the absorbing medium and a thermal storage facility is the uniqueness of this design which under certain conditions and locations may prove to be an efficient and reliable substitute to the conventional electrical air-conditioning systems. In this particular study a space cooling application for approximately 100 Tons of refrigeration is studied. Hourly variation in sunlight as well as seasonal changes for temperate climate conditions is considered. Parameters such as the cooling load of the space, and waste heat produced by electronics are evaluated. The cooling system driven by the nanofluid-based concentrated parabolic solar collector is mathematical modeled and then the optimization is done by varying the nanoparticle size and volume fraction in order to obtain the best result for collector outlet temperature, thermal efficiency and optical efficiency.

Few attempts have been made to model duplication in a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to reduce schedule length.

This paper proposes a new REStricted Duplication (RESDMILP) approach to model duplication in a MILP. The complexity of this model increases with the increase in the amount of duplication. Experiments conducted have revealed that RESDMILP achieves better runtimes when the problem instance is solved optimally and provides better lower bound and percentage gap if it is run for a fixed amount of time. The percentage gap is defined as (U B - LB)/U B where U B and LB are the upper and lower bounds achieved by the MILPs respectively.

This is a classically stable system if the more viscous solution is the displacing one. However, we show by numerical simulations based on the finite-volume approach that, in this system, double diffusive effects can be destabilizing. Such effects can appear if the fluid consists of a solvent containing two solutes both influencing the viscosity of the solution and diffusing at different rates. The continuity and Navier-Stokes equations coupled to two convection-diffusion equations for the evolution of the solute concentrations are solved. The viscosity is assumed to depend on the concentrations of both solutes, while density contrast is neglected. The results demonstrate the development of various instability patterns of the miscible ''interface'' separating the fluids provided the two solutes diffuse at different rates. The intensity of the instability increases when increasing the diffusivity ratio between the faster-diffusing and the slower-diffusing solutes. This brings about fluid mixing and accelerates the displacement of the fluid originally filling the channel. The effects of varying dimensionless parameters, such as the Reynolds number and Schmidt number, on the development of the ''interfacial'' instability pattern are also studied. The double diffusive instability appears after the moment when the invading fluid penetrates inside the channel. This is attributed to the presence of inertia in the problem.

This hybrid process enables the creation of structures that have geometries that would be difficult or impossible to create using any either process alone. A comprehensive study of DM bending mode components has been carried out in this paper by studying their dimensional repeatability and fatigue life and comparing these with similar components fabricated with sheet metal. Experimental studies have been performed for part features created by the DM "bending mode" process, in which a thin vertical wall is machined on the part, and then incrementally bent with a single-point forming tool. The dimensional repeatability of DM components is compared with sheet metal components made by single-point incremental forming and conventional bending in a press brake [Agrawal, 2010, Comparison of Dimensional Repeatability of Deformation Machined Components With Sheet Metal Components, North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 38, Transactions of NAMRI/SME, Vol. 38, pp. 571-576]. The results of this study indicate that the DM process is not capable of holding tolerances as tight as a standard milling process. This may be due to local variations in material properties that influence the yield strength and resulting springback. However, thin components created by DM are more repeatable than similar components created from sheet metal using SPIF, but less repeatable than components created by conventional bending of sheet metal. The second objective of the present work is to investigate whether components fabricated using the DM process can be considered for fatigue critical applications [Megahed, 1996, Low-Cycle Fatigue in Rotating Cantilever Under Bending I: Theoretical Analysis, Int. J. Fatigue, 18(6), pp. 401-412; Khalid, 2007, Bending Fatigue Behavior of Hybrid Aluminum/Composite Drive Shafts, Mater. Des., 28, pp. 329-334]. Studies were performed to experimentally compare the fatigue life of components fabricated by DM process with sheet metal components made by single-point incremental forming and conventional bending. Results of the study indicate that sheet metal SPIF components under the present loading conditions have significantly longer fatigue life of approximately 3900-5500 cycles, compared to DM and sheet metal conventionally bent components with approximately equal fatigue life of 2200-3900 cycles.

To understand the conditions in which such magnetic fields affect autocatalytic fronts, we study theoretically the influence of a simple magnetic bar on buoyancy-driven density fingering of a chemical front by numerical simulations of a reaction-diffusion-convection system. The model couples Darcy''s law for the flow velocity to an evolution equation for the concentration of the autocatalytic product, which affects both the density of the solution and the magnetic force. The solutions of both products and reactants are assumed to be diamagnetic (i.e., negative magnetic susceptibility) and the magnetization is oriented perpendicularly to the plane in which the front travels. We show that, when aligned along the direction of front propagation, the magnetic force is able to suppress or enhance the convective instability depending on the value of the magnetic Rayleigh number of the problem.

Due to its inherent capabilities, viz., fast, safe and subsurface feature extraction, this technique has been widely used in bio-medical imaging. In conventional passive approach, imaging may not provide enough contrast for detection of subsurface skin lesion. However, this limitation can be surmounted by using active thermography technique in which controlled energy is being supplied to the skin. This controlled stimulus not only helps in the detection of deeper subsurface details but also helps in getting the quantitative information of hidden features. Apart from the various widely used active approaches such as modulated lock-in thermography (LT) and high peak power pulsed based thermography (Pulsed Thermography - PT and Pulse Phase Thermography - PPT) techniques, the present article highlights an alternative approach which can be performed in less time as compared to LT and with much less peak powers as compared to pulsed based thermography (PT and PPT) techniques.

The heat transfer phenomenon is assumed to be governed by conductive, naturally convective and radiative heat transfer, whereas the diffusion of mass through the porous media is also taken into account. Then, using the SSM, critical parameters such as porosity, permeability, and thermal conductivities of the extended surface have been predicted for satisfying a prescribed temperature field. It is found that many alternative solutions can meet a given thermal requirement, which is proposed to offer the flexibility in selecting the material and regulating the thermal conditions. It is observed that the allowable error in the temperature measurement should be limited within 5%.

In PEMFCs, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is the kinetically slow process dominating the entire performance. At present, merely Pt or Pt-based catalysts are practical for driving the electrochemical reactions in a PEMFC environment. However, platinum comprises a large portion of the PEMFC cost. Additionally, limited supply and unsatisfactory durability constitute a major barrier for large-scale production and commercialization of PEMFCs. Carbon materials have been suggested as promising non precious metal catalysts for the ORR. Although the detailed mechanism of the ORR at carbon-based materials remains unclear, the specific properties of the exposed carbon surfaces were found to have a substantial influence on the ORR kinetics. Hence, the modification of carbon electrode surfaces for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity has become a highly interesting research topic. Consequently, different catalysts such as nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (NCNT), Vulcan carbon, mesoporous carbon and carbon materials based transition metal/metal oxide are explored as ORR catalysts for PEMFCs. These catalysts have been investigated towards their electrocatalytic activity using electrochemical measurements. Â© 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In such a two-layer fluid there exist waves with two different modes, one with a lower wave number propagate along the ice-cover whilst those with a higher wave number propagate along the interface. An incident wave of a particular wave number gets reflected and transmitted over the bottom undulation into waves of both modes. Perturbation analysis in conjunction with the Fourier transform technique is used to derive the first-order corrections of reflection and transmission coefficients for both the modes due to incident waves of two different modes. One special type of bottom topography is considered as an example to evaluate the related coefficients in detail. These coefficients are depicted in graphical forms to demonstrate the transformation of wave energy between the two modes and also to illustrate the effects of the ice sheet and the porosity of the undulating bed.

Based on variational calculus, this approach involves the formulation of a functional, which is minimized to get an optimal path. The minimization of the objective function results in a boundary value problem (BVP), which is solved using relaxation method. A variety of examples are presented to demonstrate the approach and to show its efficiency in providing good quality paths.

Recent theories have proposed that ADHD arises from alterations in multiple neural pathways. Alterations in reward circuits are hypothesized as one core dysfunction, leading to altered processing of anticipated rewards. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is particularly important for reward processes; task-based fMRI studies have found atypical activation of this region while the participants performed a reward task. Understanding how reward circuits are involved with ADHD may be further enhanced by considering how the NAcc interacts with other brain regions. Here we used the technique of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to examine the alterations in the NAcc interactions and how they relate to impulsive decision making in ADHD. Using rs-fcMRI, this study: examined differences in functional connectivity of the NAcc between children with ADHD and control children; correlated the functional connectivity of NAcc with impulsivity, as measured by a delay discounting task; and combined these two initial segments to identify the atypical NAcc connections that were associated with impulsive decision making in ADHD. We found that functional connectivity of NAcc was atypical in children with ADHD and the ADHD-related increased connectivity between NAcc and the prefrontal cortex was associated with greater impulsivity (steeper delayed-reward discounting). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that atypical signaling of the NAcc to the prefrontal cortex in ADHD may lead to excessive approach and failure in estimating future consequences; thus, leading to impulsive behavior.

The asymmetric heating is characterized by an asymmetry parameter, A, defined as the ratio of wall temperatures in excess of the fluid inlet temperature. Viscous dissipation is characterized by the Brinkman number, Br. Br <0, when the fluid is being heated and Br >0 when the fluid is being cooled. Heating and cooling have been, defined on the basis of average the wall temperatures. When the walls are subjected to equal wall temperature (i.e., A = 1), it may be recalled that the limiting value for the Nusselt number is 17.5 when viscous dissipation is included (Br â‰  0), and is independent of the Brinkman number, Br. Similarly, when viscous dissipation is not included, for the case of unequal wall temperatures, (i.e., A â‰  1), the Nusselt number in the conduction limit is 4, and is independent of the value of A, not equal to one. In the present investigation, it has been shown that the local Nusselt number values in the thermally developing region as well as in the limiting condition, do vary continuously with Brinkman number when the plates are kept at unequal temperatures. The axial location where the Nusselt number displays an unbounded swing depends on the Brinkman number for a given A, and vice versa. The axial position where the Nusselt number displays an unbounded swing depends on the combination of Br and A values and differs from the position for A = 1, Br < 0, or A > 0, Br = 0.

Calibration of the test rig was done for jet velocity and erodent concentration. Commissioning of the rig was undertaken by evaluating the effect of operating parameters (concentration and impingement angle) on the erosion rates of aluminum and cast iron. Results show that the rig was able to capture the traditional responses of ductile and brittle erosion behaviors being observed for these materials. Repeatability of the test rig was ensured, and the results were found to be within the acceptable error limits.

Several possible alternative solutions are available to control slurry erosion; however, surface coatings developed using thermal spraying are mostly used owing to their versatile nature. In this work, Ni based thermal spray coatings were deposited on a commonly used hydroturbine steel (CA6NM), with Al2O3 mixed in different proportions. Coatings were developed using high velocity flame spray process (HVFS). Slurry erosion performance of prepared coated and bare steel was investigated using a specially designed jet type test rig with sand as erodent particles. To investigate the effect of concentration on erosion behavior, sand was mixed in water at two different levels, 0.1 wt % and 0.5 wt. %. It was observed that all the coatings helped in improving the erosion resistance of the steel with one containing 40 wt % Al2O3 showing the maximum improvement. This was related to the microstructure, which controlled the micro hardness and fracture toughness of the coatings. Shielding effect of the rebounding particles was found to have profound effect as erosion rates did not show similar augmentation with concentration. Fracturing of alumina phase along with removal of coating in form of splats was observed to be prominent erosion mechanism. Â© 2013 The Authors.

Frequency modulated thermal wave imaging and coded excitation thermal wave imaging methods permitting multi-frequency stimulations cater for these needs and facilitate depth scanning of the test object in a single experimentation cycle.

Also, a criterion for size selection of gold nanorods is described based on the role of optical coefficients. Theory and methods: In this study a tissue domain (comprising a 3mm tumour and 7mm of surrounding healthy tissue) embedded with gold nanorods is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation within the therapeutic wavelength band. Optical interaction is captured using light scattering theory (Mie-electrostatic approach). The resulting temperature field is evaluated using Penne''s bioheat model. The effect of key parameters, namely irradiation intensity, irradiation duration and volume fraction, on tissue temperature is also modelled numerically. Results: With increasing nanorod diameter-from 5nm to 15nm-the scattering coefficient increases âˆ¼76 times as compared to a 1.7-fold increase in absorption coefficient. Scattering is considerably minimised by having smaller gold nanorods of 5nm diameter. For this study, gold nanorods of 5nm diameter and volume fraction 0.001%, irradiated with 50W/m2-nm for 250s ablated the tumour as well as spare healthy tissue 2mm beyond the tumour region. Conclusion: Overall it may be concluded that tumour ablation as well as surrounding healthy tissue-sparing (within millimetres immediately adjacent to the tumour) can be achieved through a combination of specified parameters, namely diameter and volume fraction of gold nanorods, irradiation intensity and duration.

The alloy was friction stir processed under a wide range of FSP conditions. The corrosion behavior of the as-cast as well as friction stir processed AE42 alloy was investigated using immersion corrosion and electrochemical corrosion tests in 3.5% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Electrochemical corrosion testing comprised potentiodynamic polarization, polarization resistance and corrosion potential trend (Rp/E c), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical as well as immersion corrosion tests revealed reduced a corrosion rate for the friction stir processed AE42 alloy. The reduced corrosion rate of the FSP AE42 alloy may be attributed to the microstructural refinement resulting in grain size refinement and presence of fine in situ precipitates.

Microstructure of the coating was characterized with the help of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Optical Microscope (OM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). It was observed that microstructural properties such as splat size, porosity, un-melted particles and surface roughness are highly affected by the alumina content in the coatings. Microhardness improved with the rise in alumina fraction and a maximum of 1151HV could be achieved with 60wt.% alumina blending. Cracking and spallation were found to be the mechanisms responsible for damage of coatings during scratch testing.

The presence of scandium catalysts in complex metal hydrides is found to improve significantly the kinetics of H2 adsorption and desorption. The exact role of these additives is not completely understood. NMR studies suggests the presence of distorted ScAl3 phase which is attributed to the enhancement of reversible uptake and release rates of H 2. In this study, we have investigated the hydrogen interaction and saturation on stable ScAl3 cluster at various sites using the density functional theory by employing unrestricted B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) and the GGA-PW91/DNP methods. From natural bond orbital charge analysis and electrostatic potential superimposed on electron density plots, ScAl3 is found to be more polarized and Sc atom in ScAl3 cluster has higher negative charge and electron density over Al atoms. H2 undergoes dissociative chemisorption on the Sc atop site in ScAl3 resulting in Sc-H-Al bridge structure. The hydrogen saturation is studied by sequential H2 adsorption on ScAl3 cluster. In the Sc site, the first H2 molecule undergoes dissociative chemisorption and further addition results in H2 physisorption with the maximum loading of 6 H2 molecules resulting in stable ScAl3H12 structure. To obtain mechanistic insights into the hydrogenation process, the transition state and activation energy of H2 dissociation on the ScAl3 system has been determined. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, several barriers remain. For example, the acquisition of large-scale datasets capable of clarifying the marked heterogeneity that exists in psychiatric illnesses will need to be realized. In addition, there continues to be a need for the development of image processing and analysis methods capable of separating signal from artifact. As a prototypical hyperkinetic disorder, and movement-related artifact being a significant confound in functional imaging studies, ADHD offers a unique challenge. As part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition and this special edition of Frontiers, the ADHD-200 Consortium demonstrates the utility of an aggregate dataset pooled across five institutions in addressing these challenges. The work aimed to (1) examine the impact of emerging techniques for controlling for "micro-movements," and (2) provide novel insights into the neural correlates of ADHD subtypes. Using support vector machine (SVM)-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) we show that functional connectivity patterns in individuals are capable of differentiating the two most prominent ADHD subtypes. The application of graph-theory revealed that the Combined (ADHD-C) and Inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes demonstrated some overlapping (particularly sensorimotor systems), but unique patterns of atypical connectivity. For ADHD-C, atypical connectivity was prominent in midline default network components, as well as insular cortex; in contrast, the ADHD-I group exhibited atypical patterns within the dlPFC regions and cerebellum. Systematic motion-related artifact was noted, and highlighted the need for stringent motion correction. Findings reported were robust to the specific motion correction strategy employed.

Hysteresis observed in the longitudinal resistance (between source and drain) while sweeping voltage at gate in a loop may be due to high viscosity of polythene oxide matrix for mobile Li ions.

Generally thermal spray coatings are used for protection against slurry erosion, however their performance under cavitation erosion is not appreciable. It is generally observed that the material removal process in cavitation and Liquid Impingement erosion is alike. In this paper, Liquid Impingement erosion performance of composite coatings of nickel and alumina, mixed in various proportions, has been investigated and compared with the uncoated 13Cr4Ni steel. Coatings were deposited using the High Velocity Flame Spray (HVFS) technique. Effects of micro hardness, fracture toughness, work-hardening index, residual stresses and porosity of coatings on the Liquid Impingement erosion performance are discussed. In depth study of the erosion mechanism in each coating and their work hardening capabilities were studied using SEM/EDS and micro-hardness tester. It was observed that fracture toughness and work hardening index of coatings correlate well with the erosion resistance.

The contextual interference effect suggests that although performance due to mixed presentation is either similar or worse than blocked presentation when tested immediately, it is better when tested after an interval. We explored whether this robust empirical effect, common in psychomotor performance, would be evident in visual feature binding. Stimuli were conjunctions of shape, colour, and location. Study-test intervals from 0 to 2,500 ms were used with a swap detection task. In Experiments 1A and 1B, participants ignored locations to detect shape-colour bindings. In Experiments 2A and 2B, they ignored shapes to detect colour-location binding. In Experiments 3A and 3B, they ignored colours to detect shape-location bindings.

Solar-to-thermal energy conversion, as opposed to solar-to-electricity, is enabled by solar thermal collectors that convert sunlight into heat at some useful temperature. We review here recent developments in solar thermal energy conversion. Our emphasis is on "direct-absorption" solar thermal collectors, in which incident sunlight is absorbed directly by a working fluid. This contrasts with conventional solar thermal collectors where the sunlight strikes and is absorbed by a solid receiver, which then transfers heat to the working fluid. Both liquid-based and gas-based direct-absorption collectors are described, although liquid-based systems are emphasized. We propose that if "directabsorption" technologies could be developed further, it would open up a number of emerging opportunities, including applications exploiting thermochemical and photocatalytic reactions and direct absorption of a binary fluid for absorption refrigeration.

Initially, a mathematical model for the forward problem is developed to simulate the IRSOFC steady state operation and its performance in terms of power output and then an inverse problem is solved for recovering the above parameters using a simplex search minimization algorithm. The objective function (IRSOFC power) and the estimation accuracy are studied for the effects of initial guess values of the operating parameters and the number of iterations required for retrieval of these parameters. The objective function is represented by the sum of square of the error between a given IRSOFC power and the power evaluated based on some arbitrary guessed values of the unknowns which is then regularized in an iterative manner for solution of the inverse fuel cell problem. The study reveals that a multiple combinations of parameters (current density, operating pressure and FFR) exist which provides guidelines for selecting feasible combinations of these parameters required for meeting a given power requirement.

The load range was varied from 5 to 20. N, whereas sliding velocity from 0.33 to 3. m/s. Worn surfaces and wear debris were analyzed using SEM and EDS for the determination of different wear mechanisms. The friction stir processed (FSPed) AE42 alloy demonstrated significant decrease in the wear rate which may be attributed to the microstructural refinement resulting in enhanced hardness and ductility of the FSPed alloy along with higher work hardening capability. At low loads, wear mechanism transformed from oxidation and abrasive wear at low sliding velocity to delamination at high velocity. At intermediate loads, oxidation and abrasion characterized the worn surface at low velocity, whereas delamination and plastic deformation were found to be major wear mechanisms at high velocities. At high loads, the corresponding mechanisms were abrasion, delamination and plastic deformation at low velocity, whereas severe plastic deformation and delamination at high velocities.

The influence of this solvent strength effect on the separation of analytes is studied here theoretically using a mass balance model describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the eluent, the sample solvent and the analyte. The viscosity of the sample solvent and carrier fluid is supposed to be the same (i.e. no viscous fingering effects are taken into account). A linear isotherm adsorption with a retention factor depending upon the local concentration of the liquid phase is considered. The governing equations are numerically solved by using a Fourier spectral method and parametric studies are performed to analyze the effect of various governing parameters on the dispersion and skewness of the analyte zone. The distortion of this zone is found to depend strongly on the difference in eluting strength between the mobile phase and the sample solvent as well as on the sample volume.

In miscible viscous fingering, the concentration gradient of the undergoing fluids is an important factor, as the viscosity of the fluids are driven by concentration. Diffusion takes place when two miscible fluids are brought in contact with each other. However, if the diffusion rate is slow enough, the concentration gradient of the two fluids remains very large during some time. Such steep concentration gradient, which mimics a surface tension type force, called the effective interfacial tension, appears in various cases such as aqua-organic, polymer-monomer miscible systems, etc. Such interfacial tension effects on miscible VF is modeled using a stress term called Korteweg stress in the Darcy''s equation by coupling with the convection-diffusion equation of the concentration. The effect of the Korteweg stresses at the onset of the instability has been analyzed through a linear stability analysis using a self-similar Quasi-steady-state-approximation (SS-QSSA) in which a self-similar diffusive base state profile is considered. The quasi-steady-state analyses available in literature are compared with the present SS-QSSA method and found that the latter captures appropriately the unconditional stability criterion at an earlier diffusive time as well as in long wave approximation. The effects of various governing parameters such as log-mobility ratio, Korteweg parameters, disturbances'' wave number, etc., on the onset of the instability are discussed for, (i) the two semi-infinite miscible fluid zones and (ii) VF of the miscible slice cases. The stabilizing property of the Korteweg stresses effect is observed for both of the above mentioned cases. Critical miscible slice lengths are computed to have the onset of the instability for different governing parameters with or without Korteweg stresses. These stabilizing properties of the Korteweg stresses captured in this present study are in agreement with the numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problem and the experimental observations reported in the literature.

Device platforms (e.g. Android) implement "limit access" and "authorize" security tactics to protect privacy/security-sensitive resources against misuse by an app. For instance, Android defines a set of 100+ permissions that guard resources such as phonebook data, network sockets and so on. However, due to poor understanding of these complex permissions, users inadvertently grant dangerous permissions to the apps, which defeat the security tactics implemented. Thus, security of a device is directly related to the capabilities granted to the intruder (app in this case). In this paper, we define a new quality attribute (QA) called Intrusiveness of an app, which characterizes the capabilities of an app to cause violation of personal and operational information of the user/device. We suggest a framework to compute "in-trusiveness" on a given platform. Intrusiveness of an app is represented as a 4-tuple. This tuple characterizes the extent to which the permissions, that are being sought by an app, could compromise in 4 dimensions of information, viz. User, Device, Carrier and the External World. It helps the user to realize the nature of privacy-sensitive resources that (s)he is exposing to the app. Efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by examining intrusiveness of 814 most popular free apps on Android. The Intrusiveness QA could be used to compute potential violation of User Personal Privacy, User Locational Privacy and violation of Device Integrity. Our analysis shows that 84% of apps examined are in a position to compromise User Personal Privacy, 96% can comprise Device Integrity and 92% can compromise Locational Privacy.

Kinetic experiments reveal that 2,4,6-trichlorophenol exhibits a lower oxidation rate than other phenols because the chlorine atoms (Ïƒâ‰¤0.22) at ortho and para-positions decrease the benzene''s electron density, in agreement with the Hammett plot. The oxidation of phenol was found to be second order with respect to phenol and first order with respect to ClO2 and a possible mechanism is proposed. The phenol/ClO2 oxidation was found to be pH-dependent since the reaction rate constant increases with increasing pH. The oxidation rate was also significantly enhanced with an increasing methanol ratio in water. The oxidation products, such as benzoquinones, were analysed and confirmed by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

PEGtide dendrons were synthesized using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) protocols. The N-Î±-Fmoc-N-Îµ-(5-carboxyfluorescein)- l-lysine (Fmoc-Lys(5-FAM)-OH) and monodisperse Fmoc-dPEG6-OH were sequentially coupled to Fmoc-Î²-Ala-resin to obtain the resin-bound intermediate Fmoc-dPEG6-Lys(5-FAM)-Î²-Ala (1). G1.0 dendrons were obtained by sequentially coupling Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH, Fmoc-Î²-Ala-OH, and Fmoc-dPEG6-OH to 1. Dendrons of higher generation, G2.0-5.0, were obtained by repeating the coupling cycles used for the synthesis of G1.0.

In the present study PEGtide dendrons up to G5.0 were synthesized. The molecular weights of the dendrons determined by MALDI-TOF were in agreement with calculated values. The hydrodynamic diameters measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) ranged from 1 to 8 nm. Cell viability in the presence of G3.0 and G3.0-mannose8 was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and was found to be statistically indistinguishable from that of untreated cells. G3.0-mannose8 exhibited 12-fold higher uptake than unmodified G3.0 control dendrons in MR-expressing J774.E murine macrophage-like cells. Uptake was nearly completely inhibited in the presence of 10 mg/mL mannan, a mannose analogue and known MR substrate. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated the presence of significant intracellular punctate fluorescence colocalized with a fluid endocytosis marker with little surface fluorescence in cells incubated with G3.0-mannose8. No significant cell-associated fluorescence was observed in cells incubated with G3.0 dendrons that did not contain the targeting ligand mannose.

One way of tackling this problem is by the use of thermal spray coatings. In the current investigation a new emerging technique i.e. cold spray coating process was used to deposit Ni-20Cr and Ni-50Cr powder on SA 516 (grade 70) boiler steel. The bare as well as the coated steels were subjected to cyclic experimental studies, in the superheater zone of a coal fired boiler. Weight change, thickness loss, XRD, FE-SEM/EDS and X-ray mapping techniques were used to analyse the eroded-corroded specimens. The uncoated steel showed weight gain after exposure in the actual boiler environment, whereas, for the coated steels there was initial weight loss followed by negligible weight change. Based upon thickness loss data the cold-sprayed Ni-50Cr coating was found to provide better E-C resistance than the Ni-20Cr coating. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is shown that disruption in tool-chip contact during modulation assisted machining helps in the formation of discrete chips. Size and shape of the particles produced in MAM can be controlled by varying modulation and machining conditions. Particulates of different shapes and sizes ranging from 100 m to 5 mm with an aspect ratio of ~10 were produced using MAM. The morphology of the particulates produced was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Deformation in chip particulates was investigated using X-Ray diffraction. The crystallite size and internal strain in particulates were evaluated using Scherrer and Williamson-Hall methods respectively. The crystallite size of the particulates was found to decrease with decrease in their size, whereas internal strain in particulates was observed to increase with decrease in their size. Furthermore, the length of particulates was observed to decrease with an increase in the ratio of frequency of modulation (fm) to frequency of workpiece rotation (fw). However, the corresponding change in microstrain and crystallite size was insignificant with change in this ratio.

Slurry erosion tests were carried out using a non-circulating type test rig at impingement angles of 30Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â°. Commonly used hydroturbine steel was evaluated under the same test conditions. At 30Â° impingement angle, the metallic glass demonstrated nearly 2.6 times higher erosion resistance compared to the steel. At normal impingement, the metallic glass was marginally better. Lower erosion rates of the bulk metallic glass at oblique impingement angles was attributed to its significantly higher hardness and deformation induced partial devitrification. For normal impingement, material was removed in the form of fragments from highly strained platelets due to limited plasticity of bulk metallic glasses. The metallic glass demonstrated a brittle mode of erosion with higher erosion rate at higher angle of impingement. In contrast, hydroturbine steel showed ductile mode of erosion under the same test conditions.

Degree of degradation significantly depends on the level of operating parameters (velocity, impingement angle, concentration, particle size and shape), which is further related to erosion mechanism. In this investigation, the effect of some of these operating parameters on erosion mechanism of generally used hydroturbine steel, CA6NM (13Cr4Ni), is reported. Morphology and variation in the martensite and austenite phases of the eroded surfaces were investigated using SEM and XRD. It was observed that velocity and impingement angle affect the erosion mechanism of CA6NM steel. Erosion mechanism was also significantly affected by the radial distance from the impact zone. Primary mechanism responsible for the removal of material at normal impingement angle was the formation and removal of platelets. At acute impingement angle, ploughing was observed to be one of the prime mechanisms responsible for the loss of the material. Other than these two well-known erosion mechanisms, the presence of another two erosion mechanisms was also observed. Models have been proposed for these unfamiliar erosion mechanisms. Interaction amongst different operating parameters was studied using line and contour plots. It was observed that the interaction between velocity and concentration was most significant. Using the experimental results, a statistical model based on regression approach was developed. Validity of this statistical model was checked using the experimental results from the literature and present study.

But, some non-standard regional varieties (NSCB), which are spoken in many parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh, register vowel-insertions in several SB and OB words with word-initial consonant cluster. In most likely cases, the tendency is to break the word-initial cluster by inserting a vowel in between the consonants in the cluster. An Optimality-Theoretic (OT) analysis of this phenomenon is offered in this article with the help of a stratification strategy for the Bangla lexicon.

The acquired data were analyzed using dynamic scaling theory. It was found that for each surface, there exists two roughness exponents which correspond to two different length scales. Moreover, the local roughness properties undergo a reversal between these two length scales before and after an etching time of 120 s. The power spectra density (PSD) curves of the analyzed images also show a reversal in the overall trend before and after 120 s. It is further noted that the PSD spectra of the surfaces resembles more that of a superstructured surface which is a distinct departure from the self affine nature of the surfaces investigated. The deviation is by far the largest for the 120 s etched surface. The morphology evolution in the present scenario does not follow the dynamical model of progressive hardening of the solid surface. Hillock flooding analyses of the AFM images exhibit the percolation nature of the process. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Heat conduction equation is recast to account for anisotropy of a many core multi-processor in which heat generated at various locations depends on whether it is a cache, processor, bus controller, or memory controller: within the core generated heat depends on the hit rate, processor utilization, cache organization, and the technology used. Thermal conductivity of and heat generation in the core are treated as stochastic variables and influence of workloads, hitherto unrecognized, is explicitly accounted for in determining temperature distribution and its variation with processor clock frequency. Relationships derived from first principles indicate that rise in temperature with processor frequency for OLTP workload is not as catastrophic as predicted by some Industry brochures! A general framework for heat conduction in an orthotropic rectangular slab (representing a many core processor) with stochastic values of thermal conductivity and heat generation is developed; the theoretical trend is validated using published data for OLTP workloads to obtain temperature at the core surface as a function of clock frequency for the deterministic case. Transaction Processing Councils (TPC) openly available data from controlled, closely audited experiments for TPCC workloads during the period 2000-2011 were analyzed to determine the relation between throughput, clock frequency, main memory size, number of cores, and power consumed. Operating systems, compilers, linkers, processor architecture, cache, main memory, and storage sizes have changed drastically during this ten year period, not to mention hyperthreading was unknown in 2000! This analysis yields the following equations for throughput and power consumed, which for a specific case of 64 processors with a main memory of 32 GB and a million users, becomes W = 1075f0.22 . For the isotropic case the temperature difference at the surface may be expressed for the case under study as Î”T = 71:1f0.22. This demonstrates that chip temperature for OLTP workloads does not increase to catastrophic values with increase in frequency. This behavior varies for other types of workloads.

It is expected that due to the widening gap between supply and demand, such instances of power failure would occur more regularly in future. Such blackouts are also be foreseen in other parts of the world. The electricity grids in many countries are highly centralized and are mostly dependent on fossil-fuel based energy sources (coal, oil, natural gas etc). Due to the rapid rise in the living standards of developing countries such as India and China, there is an increase in demand for electricity for running various appliances, as well as for heating and air-conditioning equipment. Such an increased in demand places tremendous strain on ailing centralized grid burning fossil fuel. The use of renewable energy sources (such as solar and wind) could potentially allow large amount of demand to be met though alternative means and offset the demand on the grid The advancement in technology has encouraged the implementation of renewable resources especially solar and wind. Hybrid power systems (HPS) that consist of these resources can significantly lower storage requirements. Furthermore, besides being cost-efficient, it is coherent to the weather conditions since solar and wind complement each other well. For highly efficient hybrid power systems to be developed, a significant degree of research must be applied to further their development. This includes tasks such as modeling these systems and applying proficient control algorithms to maximize efficiency. This paper focuses on simulation of an HPS consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) module, wind turbine (WT), and a lead acid battery through MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Moreover, a control algorithm is proposed, which leads to an efficient and autonomous operation of the HPS, along with maximizing power output from PV module and WT. The model and control system were tested using sample hourly solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed data to generate the power output from the PV module and WT, which was then processed through the proposed algorithm, to power a sample hourly load profile. The results indicate that a simple HPS can meet the type of load demand provided in an efficient and effective manner.

In this paper, an analytical interpretation of the phenomena is presented under assumption of two-parameter Weibull statistics for short duration wind variations. The popular concept of turbulence intensity is used as a parametric measure for randomness of wind speed. The formulations culminate in analytical expressions for two distinct metrics of power distortion, namely: (a) the short duration output power from the turbine as a mean distinct from corresponding ideal zero-Turbulence value; and (b) the output power variability as a quantification of randomness around the mean. Estimates of both metrics are presented for operating conditions in accordance with the well-known IEC 61400-1 standards. Trends indicated by computed estimates are found to be consistent with empirically observed data from field studies that are reported in the literature.

The estimations are done for satisfying a predefined temperature distribution obtained using some known fin properties from a forward method based on the decomposition scheme. Then, using the temperature information only at three locations, through the simulated annealing-based inverse algorithm, the unknowns are estimated. Due to correlated nature of the unknowns, many feasible combinations of the three unknowns have been found, which is proposed to offer the designer flexibility in selecting the fin material. The present inverse algorithm is proposed to be useful in situations where only few discrete temperatures are available, as it helps to find out the possible unknown properties which are required to satisfy a given temperature distribution.

Most of the algorithms that are used to find betwenness centrality assume the constancy of the graph and are not efficient for dynamic networks. We propose a technique to update betweenness centrality of a graph when nodes are added or deleted.

In this paper we evaluate the role that Real Options can play in helping decision making towards climate action. It also looks into whether evaluation via Real Options-keeping uncertainties in mind-will be a sensible choice from a broader macroeconomic viewpoint. While no single measure may alone be sufficient for climate change mitigation, Carbon Capture and Sequestration/Storage (CCS), along with energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy, enhancement of biological sinks, and other measures, may be able to achieve the emissions reductions needed to achieve climate stabilization. In addition, there will be important decisions in climate adaptation areas too, further adding to the complexities of decision making for climate action. In this paper, a normative case study is incorporated to determine the cost of CCS action in India. While arriving at the costs, a provision for the financial risk of storage has also been added. Given the costs, Real Options analysis is undertaken to arrive at a decision. The Real Options valuation is done using the Black-Scholes method. Ultimately, the Real Options framework is scrutinized from a broader macroeconomic perspective to understand its suitability for a more dynamic global economy as well as the effects of large climate funds on the framework, including how important a decision-making framework like Real Options is for a sustainable world.', '2013', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84894598506&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=276&relpos=76&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

The size and morphology of ZnO are characterized with X-ray diffraction, TEM, SEM, and DLS studies. The decoration of imine-linked receptors on the surface of ZnO is characterized with IR and NMR spectroscopy and confirmed with EDX analysis. The XRD results show that the average crystallite size of ZnO is 13.8 nm with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that surface-coated ZnO possesses fewer surface defects than the usual bulk ZnO. The imine-linked receptor-coated ZnO (sensor) was tested for recognition of various metal ions; however, the sensor was found to be selective for Co2+ in the DMSO/H2O (8:2; v/v) solvent system. The successive addition of Co2+ to the solution of the sensor quenches the fluorescence intensity at 445 nm with enhancement at 353 nm. This leads to the development of a ratiometric fluorescence sensor for the recognition of Co2+ in a semi-aqueous solvent system with a detection limit of 0.4 nM.

Several models were suggested for understanding the material properties of nanocomposites. The occurrence of a thin surface layer surrounding nanoparticles, where the material properties would be different from the filler and filled material, has been proposed earlier. In the absence of a commercial technology to obtain the ideal placement of nanoparticles at specified locations in the material matrix, the particle dispersion is driven by practical limitations. If the surface layer and IFD are the criteria for goodness of performance, ideally, both of these should tend towards improvements with increase in filler content. However, experimental evidence suggests the saturation of material properties with filler content. This saturation needs to be fully understood in order to optimise filler content. In this reported work, the effect of filler content on inter-particle distance and ISA in nanocomposites has been investigated. The reason for the observed saturation in material properties with filler content is explained. It is mathematically shown that the ISA also shows similar characteristics as a physical phenomenon supporting the role of the ISA in the material properties of nanocomposites.

We elaborate our methodology by readdressing the problem of competition of two species for two resources in a chemostat environment. In the case of perfect-essential resources it has been extensively discussed using Tilman''s representation of resource quarter plane plots. Our mathematically rigorous analysis yields bifurcation diagrams with a striking similarity to Tilman''s method including the interpretation of the consumption vector and the resource supply vector. However, our approach is not restricted to a particular class of models but also works with other trophic interaction formulations. This is illustrated by the analysis of a model considering interactively-essential or complementary resources instead of prefect-essential resources. Additionally, our approach can also be used for other ecosystem compositions: multiple resources-multiple species communities with equilibrium or oscillatory dynamics. Hence, it gives not only a new interpretation of Tilman''s graphical approach, but it constitutes an extension of competition analyses to communities with many species as well as non-equilibrium dynamics.

The binding constant k, which signifies the ratio of inter-channel transition rates, is introduced and the symmetric and asymmetric coupling conditions are analyzed for different values of k. The vertical cluster mean-field theory is used to study the system behavior exactly in strong coupling conditions and approximately in intermediate coupling conditions. Additionally, the consequences of particular dynamics such as totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP) and symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) in either one or both channels are investigated. It is found that the transition rates have a significant influence on both the qualitative and quantitative nature of the phase diagrams. The mathematical computation shows how the number of phases varies from 3 via 6 to 7 under different environments. Interestingly, in the fully asymmetric coupling case, the results are found to be independent of the magnitude of non-zero vertical transition rate.

The energy-resolved pulse profiles are identical in both the spin-up eras and quite different in the spin-down era, especially in the low-energy band. This correlation, along with the already known feature of strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) that was present only in the spin-down era, clearly establishes two different accretion modes on to the neutron star which produce different pulse profiles and only one of which produces the QPOs.

The problem involving scattering of oblique waves by small undulation on the porous ocean bed in a two-layer fluid is investigated within the framework of linearised theory of water waves where the upper layer is free to the atmosphere. In such a two-layer fluid, there exist waves with two different wave numbers (modes): wave with lower wave number propagates along the free surface whilst that with higher wave number propagates along the interface. When an oblique incident wave of a particular mode encounters the undulating bottom, it gets reflected and transmitted into waves of both modes so that some of the wave energy transferred from one mode to another mode. Perturbation analysis in conjunction with Fourier transform technique is used to derive the first-order corrections of velocity potentials, reflection and transmission coefficients at both modes due to oblique incident waves of both modes. One special type of undulating bottom topography is considered as an example to evaluate the related coefficients in detail. These coefficients are shown in graphical forms to demonstrate the transformation of water wave energy between the two modes.

The wide-area situational awareness (SA) aims at an early detection of impending system instability and to alert system operator to take necessary actions. Since a critical situation may be triggered in a system because of various reasons, a wide-area monitoring system needs to consider several practical factors while deploying phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the grid. This study proposes a systematic framework for analysing the suitability of limited candidate PMU locations with respect to multiple applications, which, in turn, would enhance the SA of the system operator. Five factors are chosen for assessing the potential of a PMU site viz., improving state estimation, assessing voltage, angular stability, monitoring tie-line oscillations and the availability of communication infrastructure. To quantify the contribution of each application in enhancing the SA, five respective factors are proposed. These five factors are finally integrated in the proposed framework using fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution.

For smaller values of passing constant, uniform flow and kink jam phase are present on the phase diagram and jamming transition occurs between them. When passing constant is greater than the critical value depending on the anticipation coefficient, jamming transitions occur from uniform traffic flow to kink-bando traffic wave through chaotic phase with decreasing sensitivity. The theoretical findings are verified using numerical simulation which confirm that traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the anticipation effect in the new lattice model.

The charge accumulation has been observed to be of various types like homo, hetero and packet charge, etc. Volume resistivity and its non-uniform distribution has been suspected for formation of space charge. The author has recently shown that apart from volume resistivity, diffusion coefficient plays a significant role on the type of charge formation. Several issues still remain unaddressed. In the current paper, the author investigates the role of internal properties like volume resistivity and diffusion and external parameters like boundary conditions or condition of electrodes on the formation of space charge more clearly. It has been shown that manipulation in any of the parameters can alter the type of charge formation.

The chemosensor activity of the naphthalimide-based receptor was evaluated following the synthesis of the organic nanoparticles (ONPs) using a reprecipitation method. The organic nanoparticles were evaluated for their photophysical properties, mainly using fluorescence spectroscopy in aqueous media, and the studies revealed that the ONPs selectively recognized aluminium ions in aqueous media. The sensor showed competitive binding for Al3+ and none of the other metal ions tested caused any interference in the detection of Al3+. Titrations were performed with aluminium ions, and the lowest detection limit calculated was 677 nM. The sensor was used to determine the Al3+ content of river water and acidic soils; results were validated using existing methods and the performance of the ONPs was found to be in a satisfactory error range. Finally, the mechanism of fluorescence recognition was further confirmed using DFT calculations, which showed that the aluminium, upon addition to receptor 1, takes away the excess electrons i.e. a lone pair from the central nitrogen of the diethylenetriamine part of receptor 1. This causes a reduction in photo-induced electron transfer (PET) and an increase in fluorescence intensity, which was authenticated using NMR and UV-Visible spectroscopic titrations of receptor 1 with Al3+ ions.

Results: The results indicated that, HA coatings of 10 Î¼m particle sized powder were completely amorphous, while that of 30 Î¼m sized powder consisted of crystalline HA with minor tetracalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate phases. This flame spray HA-A and HA-B coatings exhibited higher bond strength (67.8 and 49.3 MPa respectively) in comparison with other thermal spray HA coating techniques reported in literature.

Viscous fingering is a hydrodynamic instability that sets in when a low viscous fluid displaces a high viscous fluid and creates complex patterns in porous media flows. Fundamental facets of the displacement process, such as the solute concentration distribution, spreading length, and the solute mixing, depend strongly on the type of pattern created by the unstable interface of the underlying fluids. In the present study, the frontal interface of the sample shows viscous fingering and the strong solvent causes the retention of the solute to depend on the solvent concentration. This work presents a computational investigation to explore the effect of the underlying physico-chemical phenomena, (i.e., the combined effects of solvent strength, retention, and viscous fingering) on the dynamics of the adsorbed solute. A linear adsorption isotherm has been assumed between the mobile and stationary phases of the solute. We carried out the numerical simulations by considering a rectangular Hele-Shaw cell as an analog to 2D-porous media containing a three component system (displacing fluid, sample solvent, solute) to map out the evolution of the solute concentration. We observed that viscous fingering at the frontal interface of the strong sample solvent intensifies the band broadening of the solute zone. Also notable increase in the spreading dynamics of the solute has been observed for less viscous and strong sample solvent as compared to the high viscous sample slices or in the pure dispersive case.

The predictions were based upon the values of thermal conductivity (k) and incident solar heat flux (S), which have been simultaneously estimated along with the associated heat loss coefficient (U l). A binary-coded genetic algorithm is used to fulfill the objective. The study has been carried out by considering two different heat transfer models involving Fourier and non-Fourier heat conduction. The temperature fields for both Fourier and non-Fourier heat conduction models have been calculated using the finite difference method by assuming a convective boundary condition at the location of the fluid-carrying tube attached to the absorber plate. Further, a comparison has also been made between the temperature fields obtained using the convective boundary condition with those obtained using the isothermal boundary condition. The comparison reveals that the temperature field is highly sensitive to the type of boundary condition. In addition to this, the temperature field has been studied for the effects of Fourier number and the thermo-geometric parameter. This study exhibits that the estimated parameters (Ul, S and k) lie in the ranges from 2 to 3 W/(m2 K), from 490 to 635 W/m2 and from 225 to 280 W/(m K), respectively, which further emphasizes the practical utility to identify feasible materials for the absorber plate and to identify possible locations, where a given temperature field can be attained.

An efficient surface modification method was proposed in order to reduce the agglomeration among synthesised small sized ZnO nanoparticles using 2-aminothiophenol as a capping agent. This article briefly investigated the effects of capping agent like 2-aminothiophenol on the optoelectronic properties of ZnO nanoparticles. The modified effectivity of 2-aminothiophenol has been examined on the nanosized ZnO nanoparticle for fluorescence and UV-visible (UV-vis) studies. The mechanism was studied for ZnO nanoparticles light emitting capability under different conditions. By facilitating the capping of ZnO with 2-aminothiophenol, fluorescence emission of the surface defects vanishes and ultraviolet (UV) emission increases. Surface capping by 2-aminothiophenol effectively covers most of the surface defects of ZnO and results in quenching of the visible region. The UV-vis absorption spectra of modified ZnO nanoparticles has been influenced by modified ZnO nanoparticles as a result of surface modification; where marked blue shift in absorption edge results. By surface modification of ZnO nanoparticles, change in optoelectronics properties has opened the new scope and possibilities to explore and fine tune the optical character of the modified ZnO for various optoelectronics applications such as UV laser.

In power aware scheduling with dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS), tasks are made to run on low voltages, which decreases their computation power. However, it also increases their execution costs and hence, may increase the schedule length. Furthermore, applying DVFS on processors does not impact the communication delay and power consumption. Duplicating a task on multiple processors reduces the communication delay among processors, which further reduces the schedule length and improves the performance1. Additionally, duplication reduces the communication energy among processors, but also increases the overall computation energy. In this paper, we propose an integrated DVFS and duplication based solution to schedule task graphs on heterogeneous multiprocessors. The use of both techniques is optimized with Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to achieve better power and performance at the same time. To enhance the MIP convergence, each task is run by integrating the maximum and minimum voltage on a processor instead of iterating through all the voltage levels. The results demonstrate a minimum of 50% improvement in the processor power and 20 - 50% improvement in the total power (processor and communication) with a performance comparable to the other algorithms.', '2014', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84901855155&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=312&relpos=112&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

In this study, an approach to detect combined fault of unbalance and bent rotors for advance detection of the features of the fault rotors diagnosis is proposed.

ZSM-5 zeolites with nanosheet morphology (10 nm crystal thickness) were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions using multiquaternary ammonium surfactants as the zeolite structure-generating agents. Both wide-angle and small-angle diffraction patterns were obtained using only a suitable structure-directing agent under a specific zeolite synthesis composition. A mechanism of zeolite formation is proposed based on the results obtained from various physicochemical characterizations. ZSM-5 materials were investigated in catalytic reactions requiring medium to strong acidity, which are important for the synthesis of a wide range of industrially important fine and specialty chemicals. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 materials was compared with that of the conventional ZSM-5 and amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicate Al-MCM-41. The synthesis strategy of the present investigation using the new series of structure-directing agents could be extended for the synthesis of other related zeolites or other porous materials in the future. Zeolite with a structural feature as small as the size of a unit cell (5-10 nm) with hierarchically ordered porous structure would be very promising for catalysis. Zeolite nanosheets: 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (D)-based multiquaternary ammonium surfactants direct the formation of zeolite structures on both the mesoporous and microporous length scales, and yield ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets of 10 nm crystal thickness (see figure). The sheetlike nanoarchitecture is stable at high temperatures. Acid sites on the external surface of the zeolites render them active in the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules.

This is achieved by solving an inverse problem using the hybrid evolutionary-nonlinear programming optimization algorithm. The effect of random measurement errors between Â±10% has been considered. The estimated values of non-dimensional entities such as porosity and surface emissivity are found to be approximately within the range, 0.28-0.92 and 0.27-0.75, respectively.

In this work, the role of a superficially applied SnO2 coating to combat high temperature corrosion of some superalloys viz Superfer 800H (Alloy A), Superco 605 (Alloy B) and Superni 75 (Alloy C) has been investigated. Accelerated corrosion testing of the coated as well as bare superalloys was done in a molten salt environment (Na2SO4-60 %V2O5-) at 900 Â°C for 50 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 h heating in a silicon carbide tube furnace followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change measurements after each cycle were taken by an electronic balance having an accuracy of 0.01 mg. XRD, SEM and EPMA analyses of the exposed specimens were carried out to characterize the oxide scales. The bare superalloys showed more overall weight gains, in general, in comparison with their SnO2 coated counterparts. The corrosion rate for the bare Co-base alloy was found to be highest, whereas that for the Fe-base Superfer 800H a lowest. The percentage decrease in the weight gain in alloys A, B and C with superficially applied SnO2 was found to be 17.2, 66 and 50 % respectively after 30 cycles. The effectiveness of the SnO2 was perhaps due to its non-reactive nature with the corroding species and high melting point (1630 Â°C).

Simulations show that nano-wires have different elastic properties when defects are present. Embedded cracks of different sizes have been created in nano-wires to quantify in-homogeneity. The inter-atomic interactions are represented by employing an embedded-atom potential. The effect of different sizes of crack on potential energy, torque and stresses for investigating the mechanical response of a nano-wire is part of the whole investigation. It is predicted from our simulation that the presence of a crack and dimensions of the crack control the torsional response of gold nano-wires.

Link correlation in wireless sensor networks has recently attracted a considerable amount of attention in the research community. Various pioneer works have empirically demonstrated the existence of link correlations and designed novel network protocols to exploit such link correlations. While all existing works focus on the correlated receptions at multiple receivers from a single sender, in this work we empirically demonstrate another type of link correlation, called sender-based link correlation. For sender-based link correlation, we observe wireless links from multiple senders to a single receiver are also correlated. Based on this observation, we design a two-tiered data forwarding scheme for improving the energy efficiency of unicast in the network. At the micro-level, individual nodes reduce their transmission energy consumption by temporarily switching to a new forwarder or suppressing the current transmission with the knowledge of link correlations. At the macro-level, we schedule the ordering of transmission times among neigh boring nodes so that the gains from all link correlation information in the network is maximized.

In parallel, one of the fluids may contain solutes that reversibly adsorb on the porous matrix at a rate that depends on the composition of the two-fluid mixture, a so-called solvent strength effect. In some systems encountered for instance in liquid chromatographic columns or in underground flows in environmental applications, both VF and solvent strength effects may combine to influence the spatio-temporal distribution of solutes. Here, a computational investigation of such dynamics is performed. The distribution of the solute in the porous medium is affected by the combined effects of VF and solvent strength. A three component system (displacing fluid, sample solvent and solute) is modeled using Darcy''s law for the fluid flow velocity coupled to a convection-diffusion equation for the sample solvent and a mass balance equation for the solute in the mobile and stationary phases. The sample solvent is assumed to have a larger solvent strength than the displacing fluid, in which the retention parameter due to the linear adsorption of the solute depends exponentially on the concentration of the sample solvent. A parametric study of the influences of the factors controlling the VF and solvent strength effects on the displacement velocity of the fronts of solute zone and on its width along the porous medium has been performed by direct numerical simulation of the governing equations. While each of the two effects (VF and solvent strength effects) distorts and significantly increases the broadening of the solute zone, the simulations reveal that, when they are acting in combination, these solute zone perturbations are reduced.

The current axisymmetric analysis is qualitatively similar to two-dimensional analysis but exhibits quantitative variations. The current analysis is motivated towards further elucidating the physiological migration of gastric suspensions (food bolus) in the human digestive system. It also applies to variable viscosity industrial fluid (waste) peristaltic pumping systems. First, an axisymmetric model is analysed in the limit of large wavelength () and low Reynolds number () for axial velocity, radial velocity, pressure, hydromechanical efficiency and stream function in terms of radial vibration of the wall (), amplitude of the wave (), averaged flow rate () and variable viscosity (). Subsequently, the peristaltic flow of a fluid with an exponential viscosity model is examined, which is based on the analytical solutions for pressure, wall shear stress, hydromechanical efficiency and streamline patterns in the finite length tube. The results are found to correlate well with earlier studies using a constant viscosity formulation. This study reveals some important features in the flow characteristics including the observation that pressure as well as both number and size of lower trapped bolus increases.

TEM analyses of the samples S3 and S4 revealed that the CdS microspheres are composed of assembled CdS nanocrystals of ultrasmall (2-5 nm) size. Optical investigation of the samples (S1-S4) showed blue-shift in the UV-vis absorption maxima compared to that of bulk CdS due to quantum confinement effects.

For comparison, the erosion performance of unprocessed CA6NM steel was evaluated under similar conditions. Friction stir processing (FSP) is a microstructural refinement tool which is useful in enhancing the bulk and surface properties of materials. An in-depth characterization of both steels was done using an optical microscope (OM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique, and micro- and nano-indentation techniques. The FSP of the steel helped in reducing the erosion rates by 50% to 60%, depending upon the impingement angle. The improved performance of the FSPed steel in comparison to unprocessed steel was attributed to microstructural refinement, which increased the hardness and yield strength. At an oblique impingement angle, plowing, along with microcutting, was observed to be the dominant erosion mechanism. At a normal impingement angle, the material removal process was controlled by the platelet mechanism of erosion. A modified form of the mathematical model for predicting the erosion rates of the ductile materials, proposed by authors earlier, was also presented. This modified model based upon the theory of plasticity was able to predict the erosion rates with an accuracy of Â±20%.

Next, through an inverse approach, ADM in conjunction with a binary-coded genetic algorithm (GA) is also applied for estimation of unknown properties in order to satisfy a given temperature distribution. ADM being one of the widely-used numerical methods for solving non-linear equations, the required temperature field has been obtained using a forward method involving ADM. In the forward problem, the temperature field and efficiency are investigated for various parameters such as convection-conduction parameter, radiation-conduction parameter, Peclet number, convection sink temperature, radiation sink temperature, and dimensionless thermal conductivity. Additionally, in the inverse problem, the effect of random measurement errors, iterative variation of parameters, sensitivity coefficients of unknown parameters are investigated. The performance of GA is compared with few other optimization methods as well as with different temperature measurement points. It is found from the present study that the results obtained from ADM are in good agreement with the results of the differential transformation method available in the literature. It is also observed that for satisfactory reconstruction of the temperature field, the measurement error should be within 8% and the temperature field is strongly dependent on the speed than thermal parameters of the moving fin.

After each step of reducing thickness of strips by 100 Î¼m, X- ray scan and microhardness testing of strips were performed. The results show that microstrain in strips was increased and crystallite size was decreased. Moreover, hardness of the strips was âˆ¼ 40-44% more than the bulk material. Higher hardness in strips may be attributed to their ultrafine microstructure resulted from high deformation observed in strips.

The heated crust has been thought to affect observable phenomena at shallower depths, such as thermonuclear bursts in the accreted envelope. Here we report that cycles of electron capture and its inverse, Î²-decay, involving neutron-rich nuclei at a typical depth of about 150 metres, cool the outer neutron star crust by emitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the deeper crust. This ''Urca'' mechanism has been studied in the context of white dwarfs and type Ia supernovae, but hitherto was not considered in neutron stars, because previous models computed the crust reactions using a zero-temperature approximation and assumed that only a single nuclear species was present at any given depth. The thermal decoupling means that X-ray bursts and other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep crustal heating. The unexpectedly short recurrence times, of the order of years, observed for very energetic thermonuclear superbursts are therefore not an indicator of a hot crust, but may point instead to an unknown local heating mechanism near the neutron star surface.

The electrical energy generated from the turbine can be utilized further in numerous ways. Scaled prototype of the same has been developed and tested. The proposed design of a gravity-energized wastewater system in high-rise buildings for generation of hydroelectricity is being checked for its feasibility in Indian markets.

Moreover, the performance of these volumetric systems is sensitive to the amount (volume fraction) of the nanoparticles dispersed - which, in the limit, approaches surface absorption for high volume fractions.

Several inclusive experiments have been performed to measure the ICF strength function in 12C, 16O+169Tm systems at near and above barrier energies. Data obtained in these experiments suggest the existence of ICF even at slightly above barrier energies where complete fusion (CF) is supposed to be the sole contributor, and conclusively demonstrate strong projectile structure and energy dependence of ICF. The incomplete fusion strength functions for 160,12,13C+159Tb and 160, 12,13C+181Ta systems are analyzed as a function of projectile Î±-Q-value at a constant Î½rel 0.053c. It has been found that one neutron (1n) excess projectile 13C (as compared to 12C) results in less incomplete fusion contribution due to its relatively large negative Î±-Q-value. In order to understand the onset of ICF at such low energies, the driving input angular momenta (â„“) involved in the production of different evaporation residues have been deduced from the analysis of experimentally measured spin-distributions for the same projectile-target combinations at the same incident energies. Higher â„“-values, imparted into the system in non-central interactions, are found to be responsible for low energy ICF. The ICF-Î±xn/2Î±xn channels display involvement of higher â„“-values than that observed in CF-xn/pxn/Î±xn/2Î±xn channels at the very same projectile energies. It has been observed that the mean value of â„“ increases with successively opened ICF channels and incident energy.

In such fluid system, time harmonic waves of two distinct modes (wave numbers) exist. When an incident wave with a particular wave number encounters the irregular bottom, it is partially reflected as well as partially transmitted into waves of both wave numbers. As a result, some of the energy is transferred from one to another wave number. Perturbation analysis followed by Fourier transformation is used to study the reflection and transmission phenomena. Reflection and transmission coefficients of both modes are estimated up to the first-order. These coefficients are obtained in integral forms and depend on the bottom profile. One special type of shape function is considered to evaluate the related coefficients. These coefficients are shown in graphical forms to demonstrate the effects of some physical parameters like number of ripples, surface tension on the transformation of wave energy between the waves of two different modes.

An inverse problem is then solved for estimating the above parameters using a simplex search minimization algorithm. The two objective functions i.e. the net power and efficiency and the estimation accuracy are studied for the effects of initial guess values of the operating parameters and the number of iterations required for retrieval/estimation of these parameters, choosing one objective function at a time. An objective function is represented by the sum of square of the error between its measured value and value corresponding to initial guessed values of the unknowns, which are then regularized in an iterative manner for solution of the inverse problem.

The required temperature field is calculated using an analytical forward method by considering Fourier and non-Fourier heat conduction, and using this, the inverse problem is solved to predict the Fo, Ve and S* which are assumed to be the unknown parameters. The study reveals that the temperature field is highly sensitive to the Fo, thus even a small error in the temperature measurement can result in an unrealistic estimation of heating time of the collector. The present study is proposed to be useful in determining the time, the time lag and solar heat flux for controlled heating of an absorber plate within a stipulated time, which will be required to attain a prescribed/desired temperature distribution. Additionally, the study also shows that subjected to different time levels, the same temperature distribution is possible through different absorber plate materials. It has been observed from the present study that apart from SSM and DE, GSSM fails to estimate the unknown parameters at large value of Ve and small value of Fo, due to the associated fluctuation in the measured temperature field.

In MAM, controlled vibration of high amplitude and low frequency given to the tool helps in breaking the chip-tool contact during machining. Controlled breakage of chip-tool contact produces the chips as particulate at a rate of frequency of modulation. Size and shape of the particles produced by MAM can be controlled by varying modulation and machining conditions. In the current investigation, particulates of different shapes and size ranging from 100 Î¼m to 5 mm and aspect ratio of âˆ¼10 were produced using MAM. Morphology of the particulates produced at different conditions was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and tool maker''s microscope. Vickers''s microhardness testing was done to study and understand the variation of hardness in bulk brass and chip particulates produced using MAM. Nearly a 52 % increase in microhardness was observed in 100-Î¼m-sized chip particulates as compared to bulk material. To confirm this observation, microstructure analysis of bulk brass and chip particulate was done. Refined grain structure of chip particulate might have contributed to the increased hardness of the particulate as compared to bulk. Effect of modulation and machining parameters on deformation level of the chips particulates produced during MAM was also investigated using X-ray diffraction. It has been observed that with decrease in particulate size, internal strain increases and crystallite size decreases.

The treatment of brain diseases has been a major challenge since a long time. Although there are several potent drugs, which are highly therapeutic yet their efficiency is marred due to the presence of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). The BBB, which is present at the capillary level regulates and monitors the entry of all small and large molecules entering into the brain. Although this barrier is of immense importance to the brain in terms of safety, it becomes a hindrance when it comes to therapy because the drug molecules are unable to reach the brain. Various biomaterial-based strategies are being developed to overcome the BBB and deliver the drug into the brain.

The FONPs were perfectly spherical in shape and their size increased with the increase in the amount of OTL. Bigger FONPs were more fluorescent than the smaller ones and their fluorescent emission showed a strong temperature dependence due to their amorphous nature. They demonstrated specific binding towards Ag+ ions which resulted in a strong reducing ability from Ag(i) to Ag(0) to produce organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (i.e. Ag@FONPs). FONPs and Ag@FONPs were characterized by UV-visible, fluorescence, transmission electron microscopic (TEM), NMR, IR, and XRD studies. We showed that the FONPs can be repeatedly used for the extraction of Ag in a systematic manner, while Ag@FONPs can be used for the chromogenic detection of Cu2+ in biological systems even in the presence of other metal ions. A detailed hemolytic analysis demonstrated that the smaller Ag@FONPs can also be suitable drug release vehicles in systematic circulation in comparison to the bigger ones.

Gas turbine blades are subjected to excessive heating load and for safe operation they must be properly cooled for protecting the blade material from damage. This involves external film cooling and internal pin-fin cooling. Cooling using fins are used for gas turbine blades by passing cold air over small extended surfaces. However, it is found that compared to conventional solid fins, for same weight, the usage of porous fins gives better thermal performance. In order to satisfy a given temperature distribution, the fin designer needs to determine various important properties and parameters, which requires solution of inverse problems. These parameters are generally thermo-physical properties for selecting suitable material and dimensions. In this work, an inverse heat transfer study of a porous rectangular fin using a hybrid Differential Evolution (DE)-nonlinear programming (NLP) algorithm has been carried out. The energy exchange in the porous fin is governed by conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer alongwith mass diffusion through the porous media, which makes the problem nonlinear. The fluid medium is assumed to be air. Using DE-NLP algorithm, four important parameters such as porosity, thermal conductivity of solid, length and thickness of the porous fin have been estimated for satisfying a given temperature distribution. Initially, the prescribed temperature distribution is calculated by solving a forward problem based on an implicit Runge-Kutta method working on Lobatto technique. Effects of random measurement errors, comparison of number of iterations and reconstruction distributions for the hybrid DE-NLP and individual NLP, DE schemes are performed. It is observed that the hybrid DE-NLP method converges faster than other two methods working separately. For all measurement errors, a very good reconstruction of the temperature distribution is observed using DE-NLP algorithm. In addition to this, it is found that many feasible combinations of the parameters can satisfy a given temperature distribution, which offers flexibility in selecting various parameters by adjusting the fin size, solid thermal conductivity and porosity.', '2014', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84926279113&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=374&relpos=174&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

Liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry results show that benzoquinone is formed as the major intermediate in aniline/ClO2 oxidation, and the reaction is pH-dependent as the rate constant increases with increasing pH.

Using jet-type test rig, erosion behavior of coatings and bare steel was evaluated at different impingement angles. Detailed investigation of the surface morphology of the eroded specimens was undertaken using SEM/EDS to identify potential erosion mechanism. A parameter named "erosion mechanism identifier" (Î¾) was used to predict the mode of erosion. It was observed that the coating prepared using 40 wt.% of Al 2O3 showed a highest resistance to erosion. This coating enhanced the erosion resistance of the steel by 2 to 4 times. Spalling in the form of splats and chunks of material (formed by interlinking of cracks) along with fracture of Al2O3 splats were identified as primary mechanisms responsible for the loss of coating material. The erosion mechanism of coatings and bare steel predicted by Î¾ was in good agreement with that observed experimentally.

Purpose: For better insight into the dynamics of incomplete fusion, the onset and influence of incomplete fusion need to be investigated in terms of projectile energy (Elab) and entrance channel mass-asymmetry (Î¼A). A rich set of experimental data on incomplete fusion may be useful to correlate the probability of incomplete fusion with the various entrance channel parameters and eventually to develop a theoretical model code for the same. Presently, there is no theoretical model available which can explain low-energy incomplete fusion data consistently. Methods: The excitation functions of complete and incomplete fusion residues populated in the C13+Tm169 system have been measured using the recoil-catcher activation technique followed by offline Î³ spectroscopy. The evaporation residues have been identified on the basis of characteristic Î³ lines and confirmed through the decay-curve analysis. Results: The excitation functions of xn and pxn channels are found to be in good agreement with the statistical model code pace4; this suggests the population of these channels via complete fusion. Some residues are found to have a contribution from their higher charge isobar precursor decay. The precursor contribution has been deduced from the cumulative cross section using the standard successive radioactive decay formulations. The excitation functions of Î±-emitting channels are observed to be significantly enhanced as compared to the statistical model code pace4. This enhancement may be attributed to the contribution from incomplete fusion. The incomplete fusion strength function for C13+Tm169 is compared with that obtained in the C12+Tm169 system. It has been found that the one-neutron (1n) excess projectile C13 (as compared to C12) results in a less incomplete fusion contribution due to its relatively large negative alpha-Q value. Recently proposed "alpha-Q-value systematics" seems to explain incomplete fusion data.

A long chain hydrocarbon with a polar end group is used because of its solubility in an aqueous surfactant solution, which ensures that it can be used in a neutral water medium. The rationale for choosing an aryl aldehyde with -OH functionality is based upon the fact that a chelate ring consisting of an -OH group and an sp2 nitrogen donor is always better for the selective recognition of Zn2+. The sensor shows selective binding to Zn2+ in 1% Triton-X-100 solution. Binding of Zn2+ by sensor 3 leads to an approximately 300% enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of the sensor, due to the combined effects of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and the inhibition of the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process by the -OH group. The fluorescence emission profiles of sensor 1 show some changes in the low and high pH ranges, however the sensor remains stable in the pH range 4-9, which makes it appropriate for use in biological fluids.

Purpose: Several studies have been carried out to study incomplete fusion reactions at low energies, but a clear picture of incomplete fusion reaction processes at energies below 6 MeV/nucleon has yet to emerge. Further, there is no theoretical model which may give a good representation of incomplete fusion processes. Method: Off-line Î³-ray spectrometry has been used to measure the excitation functions in the 16O+130Te system at energies â‰ˆ3-6 MeV/nucleon. Results: Excitation functions for five reaction products populated via complete and/or incomplete fusion processes in the O16 + Te130 system have been measured. Measured cross-sections have been compared with the predictions of the statistical model code pace4. A significant enhancement in the measured excitation functions compared to theoretical predictions for Î±-emitting channels has been observed and is attributed to incomplete fusion processes. The relative strength of incomplete fusion has been found to increase with projectile energy. In the case of the Xe133(3Î±n) channel, the isomeric cross-section ratios have been deduced and found to increase rapidly with beam energy, indicating the importance of imparted angular momentum. The angular momentum at different energies has also been calculated. The analysis of the data indicates that incomplete fusion is associated even for angular momentum values smaller than the critical angular momentum for complete fusion. The results have been discussed in terms of the Î±-cluster structure of the projectile for various fusion reactions. Conclusions: It may be concluded that, apart from complete fusion, incomplete fusion processes are of greater importance even at energies as low as â‰ˆ3-6 MeV/nucleon, where fusion evaporation channels are expected to be dominant. The measured isomeric cross-section ratio for the dominant incomplete fusion channel is found to increase with energy. Analysis of the data indicates that the incomplete fusion contribution becomes significant even for values of imparted angular momentum â„“<â„“critical also, contrary to SUMRULE model predictions.

The analysis is carried out under the assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. Analytical approximate solutions are obtained by using the highly versatile and rigorous semi-numerical procedure known as the homotopy analysis method. It is assumed that the cross section of the tube varies sinusoidally along the length of the tube. The effects of the dominant hydromechanical parameters, i.e. fractional parameters, material constants, slip parameter, time and amplitude on the pressure difference across one wavelength, are studied. Graphical plots reveal that the influence of both fractional parameters on pressure is opposite to each other. Interesting responses to a variation in the constants are obtained. Pressure is shown to be reduced by increasing the slip parameter. Furthermore, the pressure in the case of fractional models (fractional Oldroyd-B model and fractional Maxwell model) of viscoelastic fluids is considerably more substantial than that in the corresponding classical viscoelastic models (Oldroyd-B and Maxwell models).

Using genetic algorithm, the thermal and geometrical parameters, viz., thermal conductivity of the material, surface heat transfer coefficient and dimensions of the fin have been simultaneously estimated for the prescribed temperature field. Earlier inverse studies on wet fin have been restricted to the analysis of nonlinear governing equation with either insulated tip condition or finite tip temperature only. The present study developed a closed-form solution with the consideration of nonlinearity effects in both governing equation and boundary condition. The study on inverse optimization leads to many feasible combination of fin materials, thermal conditions and fin dimensions.

(401, 'Comparison of Korteweg stresses effect on the fingering instability of higher or less viscous miscible slices: Linear stability analysis', 'Pramanik, S., Mishra, M.', 'The dispersion of the localized higher or less viscous sample/slices than the displacing fluid viscosity can be affected by the viscous fingering (VF) that arises at the interfaces of the underlying fluids. VF dynamics are greatly influenced by the viscosity contrast of the two fluids, which in turn again depends upon the concentration gradient between them. However, if the fluid diffuses at a slower rate, the gradient remains very sharp during a longer time period. Such a steep concentration gradient gives rise to a stress, called Korteweg stress, which acts as a stabilizing factor at the miscible diffusive interface of the two fluids. The fingering dynamics have been analyzed through a linear stability analysis (LSA) based on the self-similar-quasi-steady-state-approximation (SS-QSSA) method. In this paper a comparison for the influences of the Korteweg stresses on the onset of instability between high and less viscous miscible slices has been presented. Such miscible slices of high or less viscosity give rise to the opposite sign of the log-mobility ratio R and lead to the existence of VF at opposite interfaces. It is observed that due to the presence of Korteweg stresses the onset of instability delays more when the more viscous fluid displaces a sample of lesser viscous one (R < 0) than the case of less viscous fluid displacing a higher viscous sample (R > 0). Under both the cases of R > 0 and R < 0 the unstable regions in the wave number-diffusive time phase plane are found to be asymmetric in the absence of Korteweg stresses and with the increasing influences of the Korteweg stresses the unstable region observed to be more symmetrical. Qualitative analysis has been conducted for various other flow parameters such as Korteweg constant Î´, extent of the finite sample, l. These results are obtained by performing LSA study on the model obtained by coupling the convection-diffusion equation for the concentration with the Darcy-Korteweg equation. The findings of the present study are in good qualitative agreements with the experimental evidence and the nonlinear simulation results available in the literature.

Hydrogen storage is the major problem in achieving this goal. In this study, metal-organic framework (MOF) with organic linker is replaced with BN linker namely borazocine (B4N4H 8) and is functionalized with Ti, enhancing the stability and storage capacity of the framework. A first-principles electronic structure calculation using spin polarized generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional, structural optimization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed for hydrogen sorption efficiency of the Ti-functionalized Mg4O-BN framework (MBF). Low adsorption and desorption energies suggest the high hydrogen reversibility of the system. BN ring coordinates strongly with the Ti metal by Dewar interaction while each Ti metal adsorbs 4 H2 molecules by Kubas interaction. In MD simulations, 75% of the physisorbed H2 molecules are desorbed at 300 K while at 373 K chemisorbed hydrogen also began to desorb with the MBF framework remaining structurally stable. The average hydrogen desorption temperature using van''t Hoff equation is predicted to be 323 K with hydrogen storage capacity of 7.8 wt %. For the first time, the H2 sorption efficiency of the Ti-functionalized metal-BN framework has been studied and is found to be better than MOF or metal-functionalized MOF with respect to storage capacity, stability, and reversibility, making it a potential hydrogen storage material.

The large inter-connected dendrites become more fragmented with increased circularity after processing. The changes in thermal characteristics were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The reduction in crystallization enthalpy after processing suggests partial devitrification due to the high strain plastic deformation. FSP resulted in increased hardness and modulus for both the amorphous matrix and the crystalline phase. This is explained by interaction of shear bands in amorphous matrix with the strain-hardened dendritic phase.

The Î³-ray coincidences served to precisely measure the very weak Gamow-Teller transition to a final state at 991 keV. Although this transition is weak, it is crucial for accurately estimating electron-capture rates in astrophysical scenarios with relatively low stellar densities and temperatures, such as presupernova stellar evolution. Shell-model calculations with different effective interactions in the pf shell-model space do not reproduce the experimental Gamow-Teller strengths, which is likely due to sd-shell admixtures. Calculations in the quasiparticle random phase approximation that are often used in astrophysical simulations also fail to reproduce the experimental Gamow-Teller strength distribution, leading to strongly overestimated electron-capture rates. Because reliable theoretical predictions of Gamow-Teller strengths are important for providing astrophysical electron-capture reaction rates for a broad set of nuclei in the lower pf shell, we conclude that further theoretical improvements are required to match astrophysical needs.

Interactions were studied under the effect of temperature variation by UV-visible and fluorescence emission studies. Temperature induced unfolding in the protein mixtures indicated their degree of mutual interactions through simultaneous nucleation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and their subsequent shape control effects. Zein + BSA mixtures showed favorable protein-protein interactions over the entire mole fraction range with maximum close to xBSA = 0.24, whereas zein + Cyc,c showed such interactions only in the zein rich region with significant demixing in the Cyc,c rich region of the mixtures. Both hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic domains in the unfolded states were driving such interactions in the case of zein + BSA mixtures while demixing was the result of the predominant hydrophilic nature of Cyc,c and its self-aggregation behavior in the Cyc,c rich region in contrast to the predominant hydrophobic nature of zein. Zein + BSA mixtures produced small roughly spherical Au NPs fully coated with protein, whereas the demixing zone of zein + Cyc,c mixtures generated highly anisotropic NPs with little protein coating. To explore their biological applications, protein conjugated NPs of both mixtures were subjected to hemolysis where NPs coated with the former mixture showed little hemolysis and may act as drug delivery vehicles in systemic circulation in comparison to the latter. Both kinds of NPs further demonstrated their extraordinary antimicrobial activities with different kinds of strains and proved to be highly important environmentally friendly biomaterials.

In this paper, a new coding scheme, local Gabor maximum edge position octal patterns (LGMEPOP) is proposed for content based image retrieval. The standard local binary pattern (LBP) collects the sign edge (binary code) information between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. Further, the concept of LBP is extended to local maximum edge binary pattern (LMEBP) which collects the sign code (binary code) using the magnitude edges. These magnitude edges are collected based on the maximum edges between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. In this paper, we propose a new feature descriptor, octal code which is coded based on the maximum edge positions (MEP) on Gabor responses. Specially, each pixel of every Gabor response gains eight edges based on the relationship between the referenced pixel and its neighbors. LGMEPOP utilizes the first three dominant (maximum) edge positions in an octal code generation. Then, these three maximum edge positions are encoded into three-eight octal numbers to produce the LGMEPOP. Further, the LGMEPOP is classified into two categories which are named as sign maximum edge position octal pattern (SMEPOP) and magnitude maximum edge position octal pattern (MMEPOP). The SMEPOP and MMEPOP are coded based on the sign and magnitudes of dominant edges respectively. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark databases.

The dispersion can be switched from normal to anomalous along with vanishing absorption, just by changing intensity of the resonant control field. In addition, by allowing different intensities of the different polarization components of the control field, the anomalous dispersion can be switched back to the normal. This thereby creates a ''valley of anomaly'' in group index variation and offers two sets of control field intensities, for which the system behaves like a vacuum. The explicit analytical expressions for the probe coherence are provided along with all physical explanations. We demonstrate our results in transition for D1 lines in alkali atoms, in which one can obtain a group index as large as 3.2 and as negative as using a control field with power as low as 0.017 mW cm-2 and 9.56 mW cm-2, respectively.

Thermographic evaluation of melanoma has been carried out during the thermal recovery of skin from undercooled condition. During thermal recovery, the skin has been exposed to natural convection, radiation, and evaporation. The thermal responses of melanoma have been evaluated by integrating the bioheat model for multi-layered skin with the momentum as well as energy conservation equations for blood flow. Differential changes in the surface thermal response of various melanoma stages except that of the early stage have been determined. It has been predicted that the thermal response due to subsurface blood flow overpowers the response of early melanoma. Hence, the study suggests that the quantification of early melanoma diagnosis using thermography has not reached a matured stage yet. Therefore, the study presents a systematic analysis of various intermediate melanoma stages to determine the thermal evaluation criteria of early melanoma.

Herein, an original and simple chemosensor molecule, 2-((E)-(-2-aminophenylimino)methyl)-6-isopropyl-3-methylphenol (3), has been designed by combining a benzene-1,2-diamine and 2-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-6-methyl benzaldehyde, and its structure has been confirmed by the single crystal X-ray method.

There is a long history in ecology of using mathematical models to identify deterministic processes that may lead to dramatic population dynamic patterns like boom-and-bust outbreaks. Stochasticity is also well-known to have a significant influence on the dynamics of many ecological systems, but this aspect has received far less attention. Here, we study a stochastic version of a classic bistable insect outbreak model to reveal the role of stochasticity in generating outbreak dynamics. We find that stochasticity has strong effects on the dynamics and that the stochastic system can behave in ways that are not easily anticipated by its deterministic counterpart. Both the intensity and autocorrelation of the stochastic environment are important. Stochasticity with higher intensity (variability) generally weakens bistability, causing the dynamics to spend more time at a single state rather than jumping between alternative stable states. Which state the population tends toward depends on the noise color. High-intensity white noise causes the insect population to spend more time at low density, potentially reducing the severity or frequency of outbreaks. However, red (positively autocorrelated) noise can make the population spend more time near the high density state, intensifying outbreaks. Under neither type of noise do early warning signals reliably predict impending outbreaks or population crashes.', '2014', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84929840769&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=431&relpos=31&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

In the current study, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels were developed for the controlled release of lactic acid in the vagina of BV-infected women. PEG-lactic acid (PEG-LA) nanocarriers were prepared by covalently attaching lactic acid to 8-arm PEG-SH via cleavable thioester bonds. PEG-LA nanocarriers with 4 copies of lactic acid per molecule provided controlled release of lactic acid with a maximum release of 23% and 47% bound lactic acid in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and acetate buffer (AB, pH 4.3), respectively.

Pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) method is a very popular method for measurement of charge in dielectrics. In this method, an acoustic wave proportional to charge is generated by a pulsed HV. The acoustic wave traverses several material layers before being sensed and converted to electrical signal by a piezoelectric transducer. Due to multiple reflections in its path, a direct analysis of traveling acoustic wave would be complex. In this paper, we have proposed simulation of the physical model of the PEA method consisting of electrical and acoustic circuits. Using PSpice model of the method, authors have tried to address some design-related issues, which appear to have not been reported in earlier works. The acoustic circuit has been realized using analogy between acoustic wave and wave propagation in electric transmission line.

The proposed method encodes the relationship between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors with five selected directions in 3D plane which is generated from 2D image using multiresolution Gaussian filter bank. In addition, we propose the color SS-3D-LTP (CSS-3D-LTP) where we consider the RGB spaces as three planes of 3D volume. Three experiments have been carried out for proving the worth of our algorithm for natural, texture and biomedical image retrieval applications. It is further mentioned that the databases used for natural, texture and biomedical image retrieval applications are Corel-10K, Brodatz and open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) magnetic resonance databases respectively.

High-temperature oxidation behavior of uncoated and coated samples was studied under cyclic isothermal conditions at 900. Â°C for 50. cycles in a laboratory tube furnace. The oxidation rates for the bare and coated steel were evaluated in terms of weight gain data. Different characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were utilized to characterize the oxide scale. The hardness and oxidation resistance of the steel increased after the application of coating. The reduction in oxidation rate of the base steel was 94%. Moreover, the developed nanostructured coating was observed to reduce weight gain by 64% in comparison with micron-sized Ni-20Cr cold spray coating thus offers a higher oxidation resistance.

As machine learning techniques mature and are used to tackle complex scientific problems, challenges arise such as the imbalanced class distribution problem, where one of the target class labels is under-represented in comparison with other classes. Existing oversampling approaches for addressing this problem typically do not consider the probability distribution of the minority class while synthetically generating new samples. As a result, the minority class is not represented well which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce two probabilistic oversampling approaches, namely RACOG and wRACOG, to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The proposed approaches use the joint probability distribution of data attributes and Gibbs sampling to generate new minority class samples. While RACOG selects samples produced by the Gibbs sampler based on a predefined lag, wRACOG selects those samples that have the highest probability of being misclassified by the existing learning model. We validate our approach using nine UCI data sets that were carefully modified to exhibit class imbalance and one new application domain data set with inherent extreme class imbalance.

A real world problem of image retrieval and searching is considered in this paper. In modern generation, managing images from a large storage medium is not a straightforward job. Many researchers have worked on texture features, and produced diverse feature descriptors based on uniform, rotation invariant, edges and directional properties. However, most of them convert the relationship of the center pixel and the boundary pixel into a local pattern, and use histogram to represent the local pattern as a feature vector. In this work, we propose a new image retrieval technique; local extrema co-occurrence patterns (LECoP) using the HSV color space. HSV color space is used in this method to utilize the color, intensity and brightness of images. Local extrema patterns are applied to define the local information of image, and gray level co-occurrence matrix is used to obtain the co-occurrence of LEP map pixels. The local extrema co-occurrence pattern extracts the local directional information from local extrema pattern, and convert it into a well-mannered feature vector with use of gray level co-occurrence matrix.

The multiple Bragg diffraction is analyzed for photonic crystals with different lattice constants and refractive index contrasts. Angle-dependent reflectance spectroscopy indicates strong hybridization of diffraction resonances when the tip of the incident wave vector crosses the W point and the multiple Bragg diffraction is seen to be extended over an angular range of 8 deg around the W point. We also observe a new diffraction resonance in the short-wavelength region for wave vectors shifting toward the W point in the hexagonal facet of the FCC Brillouin zone. Each diffraction resonance is fitted using the Bragg''s law for different planes in the FCC photonic crystal taking into account the internal angle between the planes. The diffraction resonances in the multiple Bragg diffraction regime are assigned to FCC crystal planes with Miller indices (111), (200), (-111), and (220).

Many boundary value problems occur in a natural way while studying fluid flow problems in a channel. The solutions of two such boundary value problems are obtained and analysed in the context of flow problems involving three layers of fluids of different constant densities in a channel, associated with an impermeable bottom that has a small undulation. The top surface of the channel is either bounded by a rigid lid or free to the atmosphere. The fluid in each layer is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible, and the flow is irrotational and two-dimensional. Only waves that are stationary with respect to the bottom profile are considered in this paper. The effect of surface tension is neglected. In the process of obtaining solutions for both the problems, regular perturbation analysis along with a Fourier transform technique is employed to derive the first-order corrections of some important physical quantities. Two types of bottom topography, such as concave and convex, are considered to derive the profiles of the interfaces.

MPass is a freely available open source tool for the verification of message passing programs communicating in an asynchronous manner over unbounded channels. The verification task is non-trivial as it involves exploring state spaces of arbitrary or even infinite sizes. Even for programs that only manipulate finite range variables, the size of the channels could grow unboundedly, and hence the state space that need to be explored could be of infinite size. MPass addresses the boundedphase reachability problem, where each process is allowed to perform a bounded number of phases during any run of the system. In each phase, a process can perform either send transitions or receive transitions (but not both). However, this does not bound the number of context switches between processes or the size of the channels but just the number of alternations between receive and send transitions of each process. Currently, MPass can decide bounded-phase reachability problem for three types of channel semantics, namely lossy, stuttering and unordered channels.

Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites are being used in wide range of applications since these materials are less affected by environmental and atmospheric conditions in addition to its high strength to weight ratio. However, there are still some concerns about reinforced polymers due to their manufacturing imperfection or imperfections during their in-service, such as the presence of surface and sub-surface defects which effect their performance. InfraRed Thermography (IRT) shows its potential usage for non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) due to its intrinsic testing capabilities such as remote, whole field, quantitative and qualitative to detect surface and sub-surface defects. This present work highlights a spectral reshaping by introducing a Gaussian window on the captured thermal profile in a frequency modulated thermal wave imaging and named as Gaussian Windowed Frequency Modulated Thermal Wave Imaging (GWFMTWI) technique. Further various multi-transform techniques (time and frequency domain based) have been introduced in order to test sub-surface defect detection capabilities in chosen GFRP sample.

All rights reserved. In the current investigation, high temperature oxidation behavior of a novel cold-spray Ni-20Cr nanostructured coating was studied. The nanocrystalline Ni-20Cr powder was synthesized by the investigators using ball milling, which was deposited on T22 and SA 516 steels by cold spraying. The crystallite size based upon Scherrer''s formula for the developed coatings was found to be in nano-range for both the substrates. The accelerated oxidation testing was performed in a laboratory tube furnace at a temperature 900Â°C under thermal cyclic conditions. Each cycle comprised heating for one hour at 900Â°C followed by cooling for 20 min in ambient air. The kinetics of oxidation was established using weight change measurements for the bare and the coated steels. The oxidation products were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and X-ray mapping techniques. It was found from the results that the coating was successful in reducing the weight gain of SA213-T22 and SA 516-Grade 70 steel by 71% and 94%, respectively.

Long-time behavior of the nonlinear simulations of miscible viscous fingering (VF), which arises during the displacement of a high viscous fluid by a lesser viscous one in a porous media, has been investigated in the presence of gradient stresses. Such non-conventional stresses appear in a miscible fluid system having steep concentration, density or temperature gradient. Experiments show that these gradient stresses, also called the Korteweg stresses, cause an effective interfacial tension (EIT) and act for the stabilization of the system against the growth of the fingers. Such fluid flow systems have been modeled by coupling the Darcy-Korteweg equation with the convection-diffusion equation for the evolution of the solute concentration. These equations are solved simultaneously using a highly accurate Fourier spectral method. Investigations have been carried out for classical single interface VF instability and it has been shown that the Korteweg stress stabilizes the downstream fingers more than the upstream fingers. The propagation of the non-zero axial velocity field, which is spread away from the fingertips, explains this effect. Korteweg stress seems to act against the broadening of the fingertip that resists the splitting of an isolated finger. The growth rate of the unstable modes at an early time of the nonlinear simulations is obtained for various flow parameters and the results obtained are found to be qualitatively in good agreement with the linear stability results available in the literature.', '2015', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84910662816&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=478&relpos=78&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

While the low temperature approach limits PV losses, it would be desirable to develop concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPV/T) systems which operate at higher temperatures where the thermal energy can be utilized for electricity production. In addition to using more of the sunlight, these systems may help realize low costs as well as dispatchability through thermal energy storage. Presented here are two primary configurations: the first where the PV cell and thermal system are decoupled, and the second where the PV cell acts as the high temperature absorber. The efficiency of these systems and their ratio of thermal to electrical energy produced are reported as a function of architecture, cell bandgap, and thermal system peak temperature. The studies provide a basis to understand and compare the performance of CPV/T at different operating conditions and architectures.

Background: The reaction mechanism in the low mass region particularly at low projectile energies in heavy-ion fusion processes has not been fully understood. More and more experimental data on fusion processes are required for the accurate description of reaction processes involved at low projectile energies. In the literature, cross section data for the fusion process using a C12 beam in the lower mass region and at low projectile energies are scarce. Purpose: To understand the dynamics of fusion processes and to test various existing theoretical models, the measurements of reaction cross sections in the C12+Al27 system have been carried out. Method: The experiments were performed for the measurement of the cross sections for the residues produced in the interaction of the C12 ion with a Al27 target nucleus at 20 different energies covering the energy range from â‰ˆ39 to 85MeV. The off-line Î³-ray spectrometry based activation technique has been used to measure the cross sections. Results: The measured excitation functions were compared to those evaluated with the code pace4 based on the statistical approach and Monte Carlo procedure.

This work investigates the fundamental limits of this concept as it pertains to nanofluid-based direct absorbing collectors. This is especially important at higher operating temperatures (100-600.

Proteins like collagen are the basic building blocks of various body tissues (soft and hard). Collagen molecules find their presence in the skeletal system of the body where they bear mechanical loads from different directions, either individually or along with hydroxy-apatite crystals. Therefore, it is very important to understand the mechanical behavior of the collagen molecule which is subjected to multi-axial state of loading. The estimation of strains of collagen molecule along different directions resulting from the changes in hydrostatic pressure magnitude, can provide us new insights into its mechanical behavior. In the present work, full atomistic simulations have been used to study global (volumetric) as well as local (along different directions) mechanical properties of the hydrated collagen molecule which is subjected to different hydrostatic pressure magnitudes. To estimate the local mechanical properties, the strains of collagen molecule along its longitudinal and transverse directions have been acquired at different hydrostatic pressure magnitudes. In spite of non-homogeneous distribution of atoms within the collagen molecule, the calculated values of local mechanical properties have been found to carry the same order of magnitude along the longitudinal and transverse directions. It has been demonstrated that the values of global mechanical properties like compressibility, bulk modulus, etc. as well as local mechanical properties like linear compressibility, linear elastic modulus, etc. are functions of magnitudes of applied hydrostatic pressures. The mechanical characteristics of collagen molecule based on the atomistic model have also been compared with that of the continuum model in the present work.

Solutions for the normalized temperature distributions and the Nusselt number variations, considering the simultaneous interplay of electrokinetic effects (electroosmosis), magnetic effects, Joule heating and viscous dissipation are obtained, for constant wall temperature condition. Particular attention is paid to assess the role of nanofluids in altering the transport phenomena, through variations in the effective nanoparticle volume fractions, as well as the aggregate structure of the particulate phases. It is observed that magnetohydrodynamic effect reduces advective transport of the liquid resulting in gradual reduction of heat transfer. Increase in nanoparticle volume fraction shows decrease in heat transfer. Similar effects are observed with increase in aggregate sizes of the nanoparticles. The effect of the nanofluids on system irreversibility is also studied through entropy generation analysis due to flow and heat transfer in the microchannel.

A theoretical study on the quantification of surface thermal response of cancerous human skin using the frequency modulated thermal wave imaging (FMTWI) technique has been presented in this article. For the first time, the use of the FMTWI technique for the detection and the differentiation of skin cancer has been demonstrated in this article. A three dimensional multilayered skin has been considered with the counter-current blood vessels in individual skin layers along with different stages of cancerous lesions based on geometrical, thermal and physical parameters available in the literature. Transient surface thermal responses of melanoma during FMTWI of skin cancer have been obtained by integrating the heat transfer model for biological tissue along with the flow model for blood vessels. It has been observed from the numerical results that, flow of blood in the subsurface region leads to a substantial alteration on the surface thermal response of the human skin. The alteration due to blood flow further causes a reduction in the performance of the thermal imaging technique during the thermal evaluation of earliest melanoma stages (small volume) compared to relatively large volume. Based on theoretical study, it has been predicted that the method is suitable for detection and differentiation of melanoma with comparatively large volume than the earliest development stages (small volume).

All rights reserved. Organic nanoparticles (ONPs) of N,Nâ€²-ethylenebis(salicylimine) (salen) were synthesized and applied for specific recognition of Zn2+ and Al3+ ions in an aqueous medium. The results show that fluorescence intensity rises with the increasing concentration of Zn2+ in salen solution, proving that salen-ONPs detect Zn2+ efficiently in the aqueous medium as chemo-sensor. Furthermore, the salen-ONPs/Zn2+ system performs as an ON-OFF switch between pH 6.0 and 4.0. Amusingly, although salen-ONPs/Al3+ does not show any significant effect in the fluorescence spectra, highest fluorescence intensity was observed when Al3+ ion was added to salen-ONPs/Zn2+ in a sequential order (addition of Zn2+ to salen-ONPs, followed by Al3+). This system can be applied as a novel three inputs logic gate supported by the fluorescence for the detection of Zn2+ and Al3+ in biological and environmental samples. It appears that photo induced electron transfer (PET) occurs in the salen-ONPs when the fluorophore is excited. For salen/Zn2+ system, the PET is being inhibited considerably by lowering the receptor HOMO energy due to the formation of a bond between the metal ion and ligand, enhancing the fluorescence emission. This is consistent with the theoretical study that the energy of HOMO of the ligand is lower than that of Zn(salen)2+ complex.', '2015', 'https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-84925652838&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-t&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=E9F23FAD8B10B015AB81F6988853626D.zQKnzAySRvJOZYcdfIziQ%3a470&sot=aff&sdt=a&sl=54&s=AF-ID%28%22Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%22+60103918%29&relpos=517&relpos=117&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=AF-ID%28%5C%26quot%3BIndian+Institute+of+Technology+Ropar%5C%26quot%3B+60103918%29'),

Solar energy can be harvested via thermal, photovoltaic, and photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) hybrid technologies. PV/T systems are advantageous because they utilize more of the solar spectrum and achieve a higher combined efficiency. One approach to PV/T design is to keep the operating temperature of the PV low while achieving a high temperature for the thermal absorber. Various designs of PV/T hybrids (both flat plate and concentrated) have already been proposed which utilize air or water to remove the heat from PV cells in order to enhance the overall efficiency of PV/T hybrid collector. We propose that a nanofluid can be used instead, doubling as both the heat transfer medium and an optical filter, which allows for thermal isolation of the PV and thermal receiver. Thus, unwanted IR and UV light is filtered before it hits the PV cells, which allows for higher overall efficiencies. In this study, a new design of a PV/T hybrid collector was proposed and two nanofluid filters (based on gold and silver nanoparticles) were tested with a silicon (Si) PV cell. The corresponding stagnation temperatures of PV/T hybrid collector were measured and compared with a theoretical model. The experimental measurements validate the theoretical model, giving similar results over the range of parameters tested. The silver nanofluid design achieved the highest thermal, PV and overall efficiency and both nanofluid configurations out-performed an analogous surface absorber PV/T design under similar conditions.
